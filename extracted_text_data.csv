In Salesforce a Lead is any prospect or client who’s submitted their details

They may have:
Submitted a query via the website
Downloaded a thought leadership report
Requested a demo of our platform through a Google AdWords (PPC) campaign
Expressed interest in a mailing we sent promoting a new feature or deal
Etc. etc.
All this data feeds into Salesforce

Leads are valuable to the business; information needs to be updated accurately in Salesforce

To track whether Leads become Opportunities, information needs to be updated in SF a certain way

This applies to Leads that are both new (prospects) and Leads for existing clients

To access Leads with ease you should have this tab in your Salesforce account:

In summary…

The gap between holidaying in Britain and going abroad is almost back to pre-pandemic levels
2024 looks like being another strong year for holiday bookings; less y-o-y growth than in 2023
The cost of living looks like being less of a factor in holiday booking than it was  in 2023
British consumers buck the trend – holiday growth for the first half of 2024 vs contraction elsewhere

Category: We can use available appliances to create indoor and outdoor cooking
Product Category: We have different grills, mixer and air fryer on the survey for both GB and DE
Size of the audience: Depending on how we define it
Characteristics: using lifestyle statements and segmentations we can determine the characteristics of the audience
Penetration of cooking products: Depending on what the “cooking product” is and if it is available on the survey
Propensity to spend: Available for the list of appliances which we have (Air fryer, microwave, grills and etc). In terms of the features, we can use certain lifestyle statements like “It's worth paying extra for quality goods” and conscious choices for small appliances to see how they make a purchase decision
Needs and motivations (cooking for others): Not a lot of information here. No question which directly asks information about “cooking for others”
What way products delivering/ not delivering their needs: Not something which we can answer using the current Europa survey
How do they spend time at home: We can look at their hobbies and activities which they like to do. We don’t specifically ask if they do those activities at home or away, but we can probably make a fair assumption due to the nature of the activity. We don’t ask who do you do activities with, but we can potentially use time diary to see what time respondents are home and if they are home alone or with someone else. Some lifestyle statements could be useful here. Such as “I enjoy entertaining people at home” or “I like spending a lot of my free time at home”
Interests and media patterns: We can identify which mediums they are spending lots of time, and which channels they use to engage with the particular medium. We can also look at what genres they like to engage with on different media channel

Category: We can use available appliances to create indoor and outdoor cooking
Product Category: We have different grills, mixer and air fryer on the survey for both GB and DE
Shopping preferences: There are no conscious choices in USA. There is a section titled “buying styles” which has some lifestyle statements that can be used, but they are not category specific
What brands do they spend on / admire: We can see what brands they purchase (depends on what product categories we are talking about), but not how much they spend on them 
Outdoor cooking habits: Very specific questions asked here, which we can’t really answer. What we can deliver for this item is if people own a barbecue or grill, and if that is a electric, coal or a gas grill. We can look at generally what type of food products they consume, but we don’t ask respondents what they like to cook indoor and outdoor. We also don’t ask who you cook with or for.
 Indoor cooking habits: Similar to outdoor cooking habits
How do needs of audience map to current and future products: We can see what they like to eat and what their attitude towards food is to judge this

Despite their aversion to risk, first-time buyers are more interested in investing their money in 2024. 

% Who agree “I look for profitable ways to invest my money”:
% Of first-time buyers who agree “I trust banks/building societies to look after my money”:
The majority of first-time buyers in 2024 agree “The economic outlook heavily affects my purchasing behaviour”.

Sep-by-step guide to making the monthly deck
July 2024
TGI Monthly Decks

A guide to making the monthly decks
Monthly decks focus on the monthly topical questions in each data release for GB. These questions are only available on the months in which they are released

The topics are normally decided in advance, and the questions which go into them are drafted about 2 months before entering the fieldwork

It is the responsibility of the research executive to create a monthly deck, which focuses on bringing insights from the monthly topical questions to life for our clients

Here are what monthly decks contain:
1) Calendar of monthly topics for the past 12 months, and the next 6 months
2) Insights from the monthly topical questions, usually around 5 slides (depending on the topic)
3) List of new items added to the survey
2

It is best to start working on the monthly deck as soon as the internal pre-release version of the data becomes available. This is normally around 3 weeks before the data is meant to be released to clients. There is a release schedule which is available to view and can be used as a timeline for creating each monthly deck. This can be accessed via TGI Communications Hub, which can be accessed via this link: Data Release. There is other information needed for building the deck which can also be accessed via the Hub, so ensuring you have access to it would be a good idea.

You can build the deck using the internal data, as normally there is zero to little change in the numbers between the internal pre-release version of the data and the final version. Once you build the deck, the deck can be sent to your manager who can provide you with feedback on the deck. Remember that the internal pre-released data should not be shared with external parties under any circumstances.

Once the story of the deck is finalised, you should check all the data using the final version of the data before you share it with the team. 

Here are steps involved in creating the monthly deck. Detailed guide on how to perform each can be found in the next pages:





Start building the deck using the internal pre-release version of the data
Send the deck to your manager and wait for their feedback
Work on the feedback, make changes accordingly and finalise the deck
Once the final version of the data is out, check all the stats from the deck to make sure they are all okay
Share the deck with the team
3
Accessing the internal pre-release version of the data

The internal pre-release version of the data can only be accessed via the Choices Desktop software. In order to access the data, you need to ensure that you have the correct survey path mapped to your software. Here is how you can do that:
1) In the menu bar at the top of the page, go to tools which sits under the home tab. Click on tools, select Options and the following menu should pop up
2) From this menu, expand the first option labelled Path
3) Once you expand path, the following menu appears. Right-click on  the second line which says Survey list, and you should see an option that says Add a survey path
4) Once you click on Add a survey path, you should see the folder browser. Find the drive where all the data is stored in (normally labelled as data), click on it and as you can see variety of different surveys are stored in there. You need to go to the Internal folder, click on it and then click on a sub-folder titled Pre-Release. Once you select that, press OK. In order for this change to take effect, you need to close and re-open your Choices desktop.
4
Accessing the internal pre-release version of the data

Now that you have mapped the correct survey path to your Choices Desktop, you need to open the survey. Here is how you do it:
1) On the home tab in the menu bar, click on the sheet of paper where it says Create New, and the following menu will appear
2) In this menu, you can either scroll and find the survey you need, or you can use the survey filter. Let’s say we are building the deck for June 2024. In the survey filter bar type in 2024 June and click search
3) Once you have searched for the needed survey, you can select the relevant internal folder. In this case, we are looking for INTERNAL GB TGI 2024 June. Once you click on that folder, you would need to choose to pop the weighted ascribed option. The data gets ascribed multiple times before it is finalised and released to clients, hence the reason there are different ascribed files with different dates available. Around 3 weeks before the release of the data, check this space and once the first Pop Weighted Ascribed version becomes available you can use that to start building your deck.
5
Analysing the data

Once you have opened the survey you need, you can start building your cross tabs. The data from monthly topics sit right at the top of the dictionary. Analysing data in Choices desktop is fairly similar to how you analyse the data in Choices Online. So, once you have been trained in using Choices Online you should be able to use Choices desktop as well.

If you need any help using the software, you can get in touch with the client services team.

Try to keep your cross tabs neat. Once the data is released, you would need to upload the data files into Choices Online and share it with the team. So, keeping the cross tabs nice and clean makes it easier for the rest of the team to read and understand what you have done. It’s easiest to have one Choices file per slide (or more if it means reading it would be easier). Label the files clearly so people would know what each file contains. For example: Slide 1 – Christmas presents

As a rule of thumb, try to have one slide per question in the monthly topics, or one slide for two questions if they complement each other. Try to use the rest of the TGI dictionary when building the deck, this can show the depth and utility of TGI. When creating the slides, think about what you are putting on the slides and ask yourself: is this interesting? Is this of any value to our clients? Try to ask yourself these questions, especially at the beginning. Once you are more familiar with TGI and how our clients use it, then it will be easier to know what our clients would find interesting.
6
Sending the deck for feedback

Once you have created the deck, you need to send it to your manager/ relevant person to ask for their feedback. Ideally, you would want to do this at least 10 days before the data is meant to be released. The best way to share is to share the link to the deck, as it is a lot easier to receive feedback and work on the changes this way. Do let your manager know that the data is from the internal pre-release version and that you will check all the figures once the final version of the data is out. Before you send the deck make sure you have:
Checked all the spellings
Read through the deck to make all the stats are clear
Once you receive the feedback, go through the comments. If there are changes that can be made, make them. If you think certain things are not possible to do, or if you do something which was suggested in the feedback and the results don’t work well, let the person who provided you with feedback know. It’s likely that you might go through some back and forth before you get the all-clear on the deck, but that is normal. This is how we ensure that the deck is ready and suitable to be shared with our clients
7
Checking all the stats using the final version of the data

Once the final version of the data is available, you will need to check all the stats using that data. How you do this is by changing the internal survey to the final version of the data. If by this point, you are still in the middle of getting feedback for the deck you can start checking the stats as usually the numbers do not change, or change minimally here and there.

To perform this you would need to add the current survey folder path to your Choices desktop. Simply follow the same steps mentioned in slide 4, and in step 4 choose the Current folder. Remember you would need to restart your software for the changes to take place. Once you have done that, follow the below steps:
1) Open the first internal pre-release file which you have used to make your deck. Go to change survey which sits under the home tab at the menu bar at the top
GO TH THE NEXT SLIDE FOR THE NEXT STEPS
8

2) Since we are working with the June data, search 2024 June in the search bar, Expand the folder titled GB TGI 2024 July (June 2023- May 2024) CLIENT SERVICE MASTER and then choose the pop option. After that press Accept on the bottom right side of the menu Remember it’s the CLIENT SERVICE MASTER folder which you would always need. 
3) The system now brings you back to your cross tab, but all the data are now from the final version of the data. Check all the numbers in your deck and make sure they match the ones in your cross tabs. Make changes if there are any differences. Repeat the process with all your files
4) Once you have checked the stats and you are done with the file, you should save it so you can access it if needed. You should also save it as a spec file which you can use to upload it to Choices Online and share it with the team. How you do that is by pressing the Choices logo at the top left of the screen and choosing SAVE TO SPEC FILE from the pop-up menu. Repeat steps 1 to 4 for all your files
9
Slides covering newly added items

Once you are done building the insight part of the deck, you need to add the slides covering what items have been added to the survey in that release. As mentioned before, you can find all the information in the TGI Communications Hub via this link HUB

The document which you need from Hub is the New Data Report. This is available for all TGI releases and lists all the newly added items. You would need to list all of the new items in the Excel file in the monthly deck using the existing format in the deck. See an example of this in the next page
10
Example of a slide covering new additions to the survey

11
Uploading Choices Desktop files to Choices Online

1) Open a Choices online report and click import and select .spc file. Choose the spec file which you saved from Choices Desktop and open it.  
2) Once you import your file you can save it. Keep the name as it is. Import all your files and save them all. Once you are done, go to the home page of Choices online and click on the files button on the right side. Sort your files by date so you can see the ones you just saved right at the top. Select all the files for that monthly topic and create a folder and give it the relevant title e.g. June 2024 Deck. Share the folder with the account directors and managers
12
Checking the file size

Now that your deck is ready, its time to share it with the team. 

The first thing you need to ensure is that the file size is not larger than 15MB. Here is how you do that:
















1) In the top left side of the screen in PowerPoint, press File
2) On the menu on the left-hand side choose info. After that, you should be able to see the properties of the file including the size on the right-hand side.
If the size is less than 15MB, great! If not follow the steps on the next page to make it smaller.
13
Reducing the file size

Here are the steps to follow if you need to reduce the file size.
Here we have a deck that is 34MB in size
To reduce the size, click on a picture in the deck. At the bar menu at the top, go to Picture Format and then Compress Pictures (have circled them both in the picture)


CONTINUES ON NEXT PAGE
14
Reducing the file size

When you click on Compress Pictures, deselect the option “Apply only to this picture”. 

You have a couple of options for reducing the resolutions. Choosing the Web (150 ppi) option should do the job without losing much picture quality for such a deck.
After performing this step, the size of the files has gone from 34MB to 1.21MB
15
Emailing the deck

Before you send the email, upload a copy of the deck to SharePoint. Here is the location where you should upload it to Monthly Topic Decks 

Normally the email includes the questions from the monthly topics, as well as the newly added items for that month. See one of the emails previously sent and you can use that as a template.

Attach the deck, and also put a link to the deck which you uploaded to SharePoint. If you have already shared the choices Online files with everyone, let them know you have done that in the email. If not, let them know that you will be sharing it with them soon.

Send the email to UK TGI ALL and CC Christine Mathews and Supriya Pillai as well.
Once you have checked the file size/ have reduced the file size, you can share the deck via email.

There are three sections in the monthly deck

2
Timeline of the monthly deck

Here are the steps involved in creating the deck





1) Start building the deck using the internal pre-release version of the data
2) Send the deck to your manager for feedback
3) Work on the feedback, make changes and finalise the deck
4) Once the final version of the data is out, check all the stats from the deck to make sure they are all okay
5) Add the newly added items, read through the deck and share with the team
3
1) Analysing the data using the pre-release data


Check when the data is meant to be released. There is a release schedule available on the Communications Hub. 

From around 4 weeks before the release date, start looking at Choices Desktop to see if the data is available. 

There are going to be different versions of data becoming available throughout the process until the data is released. You would need to wait for the Ascribed version of the data to become available and then you can use that to start your analysis.

Keep your cross tabs clean and neat. Save them and label them clearly as you would need to share them with the rest of the team.

4
2) Receiving feedback


Once you have your deck ready, it is time to share it with your manager or the person who is going to provide you with feedback. Before you share the deck make sure that:

You have read through the deck and everything makes sense
You have checked spelling and grammar

 It’s best to share the link to the deck, that way it is easier to receive feedback and work on the changes.


5
3) Working on the feedback



Once you have the feedback, go through the comments. Where it is possible, make changes accordingly

If you think the proposed changes are not possible to make, or if you look at the data and the story is not interesting let the feedback provider know.

It’s likely that you might have to go through a bit of back and forth until the deck is finalised, so that is normal. Over time there will be fewer back-and-forth, and the process will become quicker

6
4) Checking all the numbers using the final data



Once the final version of the data becomes available, you should change the surveys in your Choices files from the pre-release survey to the client service master survey.

Check all the numbers match the ones in your deck. Adjust if necessary.

Once you have checked the numbers and you are done with each file, save them in case you will need them in future. Also, save them as spec files so you can upload them to Choices Online and share them with the team

7
5) Final section and sharing the deck



Once your deck is finalised, you would need to add the slides on what is new in this release. You can find this information in the New data report file which is made for every release and can be accessed in the communications hub. 

Before you share the deck, read through and make sure there are no mistakes.

Upload a copy to SharePoint.

Send an email to UKTGIALL and CC the Irish team. Attach the deck and also share a link to it in the email

8
Building the deck

Here are some practical tips
Go through the questions for the monthly topics before you start building the deck. Think about what is interesting and the insights which you can extract from the questions.
Try to have one slide per question, or one slide for two questions if they complement each other
Try to keep slides neat and clean. When making such decks, on most occasions less is more, so don’t have too much text or too many insights in one slides. You can always split things into more slides if it means they are going to be more clear
9
Building the deck

What to keep in mind while you are working on the deck

Question yourself: Will clients find this interesting? An interesting bit of insight should capture the attention, and make the reader think about what they saw rather than asking “So what?”
Generally, you can keep things topline. A table of statements sorted by vertical % or a bar chart are great ways of showcasing the data. When there is an opportunity, try to dig deeper and show the depth of TGI.
Question the validity of the data. If something looks odd to you, like an abnormally high or low number, don’t be afraid to let Ops know. 
Try to summarise the key points of each slide in the title and subtitle. Assume that not everyone will read the entire slide, but if they read the title and subtitle, they should know the main insights from the slide.

Example


Topline insights

Closer look at interesting/ valuable audiences
11

useful design tips

Use boxes with rounded corners, they look more slick. 
Use shadows, they give a nice effect to shapes.
Follow text hierarchy. The audience will read the biggest text first and will follow the size of the text in order
Use icons where possible. That is a great way to make the slides look professional without too much effort
Right-click on the shape
Go to Format Shape
Go to effects (pentagon icon)
Choose the “Offset Centre” option under preset
Reduce size from 102% to 100%

Use gradient fills on shapes rather than solid fills

Useful tips to make creating the decks easier

HOLD CTRL AND DRAG: for copying objects
CTRL + Y: Duplicating the object and the distance
CTRL + SHIFT + C: Copying style
CTRL + SHIFT + V: Pasting style
HOLD SHIFT: For drawing the perfect circle or square




HOLD CTRL + SHIFT AND DRAG: for copying objects and remaining steady on the axis

Using lifestyle statements, TGI captures GB’s feelings towards cars and driving
You can judge a person by the car they drive
My car is only there to get me from 'A' to 'B'
I would mainly choose a car based on how it looks
My car should catch people's attention
I like to drive fast
I like driving
My car should express my personality
My car should be equipped with all possible safety features
I like innovative cars
I am not interested in what goes on under the bonnet of a car
I would choose a British car to support the national economy
I would choose a car over public transport
All new cars should be electric
I value car manufacturers who are socially and environmentally committed
I worry about rising fuel prices
My main concern about Electric Vehicles is the lack of charging stations away from home

Category: We can use available appliances to create indoor and outdoor cooking
Product Category: We have different grills, smoker, mixer and air fryer on the survey (and some other appliances)
Size of the audience: Depending on how we define it
Characteristics: using lifestyle statements and segmentations we can determine the characteristics of the audience
Penetration of cooking products: Depending on what the “cooking product” is and if it is available on the survey
Propensity to spend: Not available in the USA as far as I could see
Needs and motivations (cooking for others): Not a lot of information here. No question which directly asks information about “cooking for others”
What way products delivering/ not delivering their needs: Not something which we can answer using the current Europa survey
How do they spend time at home: We can look at their hobbies and activities which they like to do. We don’t specifically ask if they do those activities at home or away, but we can probably make a fair assumption due to the nature of the activity. We don’t ask who do you do activities with, and there is no time diary in USA data
Interests and media patterns: We can identify which mediums they are spending lots of time, and find out more about their relationship with different mediums in more detail
1

Shopping preferences: Using conscious choices, lifestyle statements and shopper archetypes we can see their shopping preferences and what drives those preferences
What brands do they spend on / admire: We can see what brands they purchase (depends on what product categories we are talking about), but not how much they spend on them 
Outdoor cooking habits: Very specific questions asked here, which we can’t really answer. What we can deliver for this item is if people own a barbecue or grill, and if that is a electric, coal or a gas grill. We can look at generally what type of food products they consume, but we don’t ask respondents what they like to cook indoor and outdoor. We also don’t ask who you cook with or for.
 Indoor cooking habits: Similar to outdoor cooking habits
How do needs of audience map to current and future products: We can see what they like to eat and what their attitude towards food is to judge this
Role of quality and innovation: Can use lifestyle statements which are available

Attitudes towards going to university
This deck looks at how the 7-19-year-olds in GB feel about going to university. Is that something they are interested in? Do they find attending university an important thing in life? 

We also look at older children who are potentially going to university soon and how best to reach them.
The latest edition of Youth TGI data is now released and you should be able to access it.

What are the key insights in this deck?
GB TGI 2024 April (March 2023 - February 2024)- © Kantar Media 2023

Almost all adults say they will consider paying for services outside the NHS, but looking at the past 12 months only 71% have done so - or 49% excluding dental and prescription 

Pressures on the NHS have had a more severe impact on the health of certain groups, such as those with mental health conditions

Given the mounting pressure on the NHS, it's not surprising to see that 1in10 adults in GB are now considering paying for private health insurance

More than half of Brits would rather their mourners donate money to charity than buy flowers when they pass away. This could be a valuable opportunity for charities to raise money for their causes

What are the key insights in this deck?
GB TGI 2024 May (April 2023 - March 2024)- © Kantar Media
Here are the main highlights
More than half of podcast listeners find it annoying when there is a mismatch between the ads and the podcast’s brand 

Those who prefer podcasts from existing celebrities could be an ideal target group. The majority are under 45, earn well and have a higher tendency to be tempted by advertising

Listeners pay the most attention to ads during the podcast rather than ads at the beginning or the end

Suggestions from friends are the main way of discovering podcasts. Those who are likely to be persuaded by ads are more likely to discover new podcasts by searching

4
The majority of podcast listeners are irritated if ads don’t fit the podcast brand
GB TGI 2024 May (April 2023 - March 2024)- © Kantar Media

Suggestions from friends are the main way of discovering podcasts. Those who are likely to be persuaded by ads are more likely to discover new podcasts by searching

While tags for video content and ads are different, they are written in the same languages and require the same skill sets in development and maintenance
The systems used for the ingestion of data coming from tags are identical in Media. Every existing system that ingests content data can also be configured to ingest ads data
Artemis uses the same „hiqh quality panels“ that are used for TAM and CMAM. The „large scale panels“ used for Artemis can potentially also be used to improve content measurement  


Panel technologies like Focal Meter, Virtual Meter and also server2server integrations with walled gardens are virtually identical for both CMAM and Artemis
The methodologies for CMAM and Artemis share a lot of common approaches and techniques. While the requirements to each are slightly different, they require the same skill sets. 


The requirements towards making data available are different for each use case. But a lot of the basic technologies and approaches are shared between the two

Cross Media Audience Measurement

Simplified outline
19
This model is adaptable to the specificities and requirements of each market 

The Extended TV model is delivered through a hybrid approach that combines key products and capabilities within Kantar
TV set and router-based metering technology

Through our panels, we are able to measure all online video consumption within the household in real time. Viewing is identified at a device level and attributed to individuals in the home providing household and respondent data (demographic profiles, cross-platform behavior and reach estimates).
Census Data Collection

We deploy our video tagging technology to facilitate the gathering of viewing data and optimise the speed of delivery. This census data at scale provides total viewing for all programmes with validation of data received directly from broadcasters as well as estimated reach and viewing time spent where participation of players cannot be guaranteed. 
Data Science Techniques

A range of hybrid audience measurement frameworks are leveraged to integrate multiple data sources into a single currency that provides key metrics such as unduplicated reach and audience demographics. Panel and census data complement each other.
Return Path Data
Kantar uses large amounts of data sourced from set-top-boxes and other devices with a return path (Over The Top and Smart TVs) to provide a deeper understanding of pay-tv consumption and deliver insights into subscriber behaviour. 
20
Our most advanced metering technologies
People Meter 7
Measurement of viewing data on the TV set. A simple to use touch-screen interface, handset and mobile app makes it easy for panellists to indicate which people are in front of the TV.

Focal Meter 2
Measurement of online TV and video content on all platforms and devices that are connected to the home network, including fast internet broadband connections, enabling a complete view of online video consumption.
RateOnAir Meter
Measurement of a panellists’ media consumption when they are on the move and at any time, whether the content is TV, video or radio/audio. The RateOnAir Meter is the result of a partnership between Kantar and Mediamétrie.

We provide a range of meters that measure media consumption among audiences in real time. They can be configured to the specific needs of any given market.
21
Focal Meter is connected to the router in the home network
Focal Meter primarily measures what is viewed over the home’s internet connection, but combined with tagging technologies it tracks viewing outside the home networks (i.e. 4G). 
A whitelist of URL’s is used to restrict the traffic captured by the meter. This ensures privacy and data collection according to panel member consent.
As well as recognising Kantar’s tags, the Focal Meter can also identify other certified tags from partners.
For untagged content, overall reach and duration estimates within the home network are provided for whitelisted video players and websites.

Tagging for census data
Approaches

Tailored to our methodology and seamless integration with our panel technologies 
End to end QC controlled by Kantar from tagging to data delivery
Lightweight tags and low latency measurement
KANTAR owned and operated redundant infrastructure 

Sub second accuracy in Video measurement

Kantar tags are specifically designed for audience measurement and do not offer deep analytical capabilities 
30

Kantar content tagging: The most secure and preferred approach
Tagging for census data

Approaches
Using existing data sources (tagging) from the publishers
31

One Tag for both your analytical and audience measurement purposes
Lower effort for tag maintenance in your players / sites

All requirements for audience measurement must be met in terms of measurement accuracy and latency. 
Census providers must provide line by line usage data containing identifiers (100% disaggregated dataset)
Providers must be willing to submit to regular audits
Strict SLAs must be signed by the providers

Tagging for census data

Approaches
Direct integration with 1st party data: Mitigating cookie issues 


32

Direct integration for access to people-based data by matching ID’s from publisher (CRM) data with Panel data in a secure way

Census data (tagging totals) still needed. 
1st Party data available (tag-agnostic) or still use tagging implementation, 
only capturing behaviour, not PII

Requires explicit consent of the matched panellists
“Safe room“ interface setup and maintenance required from publisher
Different sets of PII on both sides of the match may lead to low match rates. 

Downside: certification / currency grade comparable

The goal of data integration is to strengthen the panel measurement by using the highly granular census measurement and combine the best available information from both worlds: 
Panel data offers person-based cross-platform data with demographics.
Census data offers granular, accurate long tail usage data for devices. 

The integration & calibration of the two datasets bring together people and devices to provide granular, viewer-centric data.

Everything @scale
Improving the solutions by adding scale

In our calibration methodology a well managed VAM-panel is the core element for demographic profiling.
Our SearchNet methodology will always provide a profile but due to panel size limitations there is a risk of generic profiles for long tail of smaller content. 
Additional first- or third-party data is optional for the calibration process.
Additional data are often large scale but have weaknesses and biases
Utilising additional data with demographic information will complement our existing offering, providing better insights into profiles and the long tail. 

Scaling: Improving Demographic profiles for online content
Utilising 1st and 3rd-party data

38

Cost effective usage of existing data
Large scale disaggregate census data with demographics
Enrich data integration by providing additional source for demographic profiling
Enhanced quality of profiles
Improved coverage of demographic groups
Improved understanding of niche broadcasting
 Key benefits



 Challenges

Logins shared within households
Users may not declare their actual demographics
Shared devices and co-viewing events difficult to detect
Privacy-conscious groups underrepresented
GDPR and consent issues may diminish broadcaster willingness to share data.

Scaling by Broadcaster registration data
1st party data based on user logins 
39
 Key benefits
Challenges
Scaling: TAM with enhanced granularity

TAM services sometimes encounter issues due to limited panel sizes, creating instability or reporting issues for the longtail.
Large scale HbbTV or ACR data from SmartTVs may be used to improve granularity and reduce zero cell ratings in a TAM panel. 
HbbTV/ACR data can be integrated with a subset of the TAM panel having access to HbbTV data by using virtual panel expansion and fusion methodology. 
Delivering a overnight service that still includes currency grade panel demographics and reach, but adds significant scale by using other TV data assets.


40
Fusing HbbTV/ACR census to TAM (implemented for Numeris POC)
Scaling: TAM with enhanced granularity
41



More stable ratings result in better inventory management
Enhanced quality of ratings for smaller programs 
Enhanced quality of ratings for smaller audience segments
Large scale disaggregate census data with demographics
Cost effective usage of (existing) scaled data
HBBTV scenario can be set up independent of cable operators
 Key benefits



 Challenges

Coverage of HBBTV/ACR data assets might be incomplete
Dependency in day-to-day delivery on 3th parties.
GDPR and consent issues may diminish willingness to share data.

Tools: Brandwatch. A social media monitoring and analyse tool which gathers content from consumers from publicly available social media including Twitter, Instagram, Forums, Reviews, Reddit, Blogs and YouTube.
Process: For each topic (DIY, Garden, UK Holidays, Flights to etc) we created sophisticated Boolean queries to gather relevant conversations & posts. RT’s are removed so volumes indicate “no of people talking about.” Rules are then created to categorise each topic into subtopics. For instance “Flights to” conversations have been categorised into regions, countries and destinations. If a post says “we are thinking of a flying to corfu” this post is categorised as Region (Europe), Country (Greece), Destination (Corfu). 
Tools: SimilarWeb
Process: The estimated monthly visits is pulled for each of the top 20 organic search domains as discovered via the Search & Clicks Process. Note that there will be non-specialist domains in this list - e.g. Youtube.com, as they are important parts of the search network.
Tools: Google Ads, KeywordTool.io
Process: Using the topic Garden as an example we identify the main themes or Keyword groups. For Garden there are 28 Keyword groups (for example Grow Vegetables, Gardening Tools and Landscaping). Under each Keyword group there are between 10-50 search terms. For example the search terms under Grow Vegetables are “Grow vegetables in pots,” “grow vegetables indoors” etc.
Tools: MavensKit SearchMonitor and MavensKit CTR Model
Process: Each keyword is fed into SearchMonitor which completes a search on Google on mobile and desktop.  The first page of organic results are returned which each destination URL.  The keyword search volume and our CTR model is combined to forecast the number of clicks going to each URL each month. For each Topic, the estimated number of clicks going to each of thousands of URLs is summed by domain e.g. amazon.co.uk and the top 20 domains are calculated. 
Note that there will be non-specialist domains in this list - e.g. Youtube.com, as they are important parts of the search network.

Tools: Kantar WorldPanel+
Process:80k UK panellists scan their receipts for every purchase they make. Data, such as the retailer, the products and the price paid is captured and categorised. This enables trends and demographic breakdowns of spend behaviour for all the topics we have receipt data for. It also allows us to see which brands / retailers consumers are buying products from, online and offline.

Identify and seize new demand opportunities
People the world over are beginning to recognise that the threat 
created by the pandemic is not over and that we will have to 
live with the virus and its implications for a long time to come. 
But while some only focus on threats others see opportunity, as 
disruption creates new tensions and new needs that brands can 
address. Knowing what the new demand opportunities are and 
what is currently top of mind with consumers is absolutely key.
To adapt and survive organisations more than ever need 
actionable insight from good data to aid quicker and better 
decision making. However, with stretched budgets, organisations 
have limited access to quality data leading to either missed 
opportunities or ineffective digital media investment. Kantar’s 
Digital Activation Engine (DAE) brings quality and purposeful 
data from social media, search, shoppers and sales at an 
affordable price. The purposeful integration of passive, 
behavioural data from these sources will enable organisations to:
—  Identify new demand opportunities
—  Understand people’s needs and who is meeting them
—  Prioritise message and merchandise
Disruptions change the playing field by creating new 
opportunities and causing emerging trends to become 
mainstream. In this new environment, organisations with access 
to Kantar’s DAE will have the upper-hand. And when changes 
happen on a weekly basis, you need to know what is happening 
now, not learn about it after the fact.
For more information please contact your local representative 
or visit www.kantar.comIn April 2020 the Chief Marketing Officer Council surveyed 
16,000 members (in around 10,000 companies) in an effort to 
understand the global pandemic’s impact on global strategies, 
operations, budgets, and outlook.
The CMO Council said, “marketers are being forced to make 
decisions the “old-fashioned” way, tapping into their experience 
of, instincts about and knowledge of customers and the market, 
rather than following the data.”
90%expect to make changes to their marketing plans
66%said they do not have enough real-time 
visibility and insight into the pandemic’s impact 
across both the demand and supply chains
69%are not satisfied with “the quality, timeliness, 
and usefulness of decision support data”
Combining quality data from across Kantar
Through an interactive, self-service platform, brands can access actionable and 
affordable insights from a range of data sources which keep you on the pulse of

TGI’s holistic customer insights enriched Visa’s segment profiles with thousands of new data points around their financial mindset, lifestyle and detailed media behaviours.
TGI filled gaps in the understanding of their consumers and made their global segmentation more actionable.
Leading online retailer ebay chose Kantar Media’s TGI to improve their understanding of how shopper behaviours have changed during the pandemic to grow its revenue share.
Using the thousands of shopper datapoints on TGI, Kantar partnered with ebay to identify its fastest-growing customer segment. 
The actionable segmentation enabled ebay to tailor their messaging and media campaigns to target and engage with that group of GenZ online shoppers.


Betway and their agency used Kantar Media’s syndicated TGI data to build a profile of their target customers based on key online AND offline behaviours.
Partnering with Eyeota, the TGI segments were modelled and activated with a programmatic advertising campaign that delivered a 6x increase in website visits and 88% reduction in cost per acquisition.

TGI Case Studies
How TGI has helped brands to achieve their growth goals

Providing a deeper understanding of Visa’s customer segments

As one of the world’s largest financial services companies, Visa has a wide and diverse customer base across many markets and several continents.​​
Visa wanted to understand what makes their different groups of customers tick. They wanted to know how close their customers are to Visa’s products, their financial attitudes and their affinity to different payment methods​​
Visa needed data and insights to optimise the relevance of the products  available across different markets in Western Europe and improve their communications and go-to-market strategy.
.
Kantar Media partnered with Visa to map their customer segments to our syndicated consumer insights survey – TGI – the global leading currency for media planning. ​
TGI’s holistic consumer insights enriched Visa’s segment profiles with thousands of new data points around their financial mindset, lifestyle and detailed media behaviours. ​
This connected intelligence approach enhanced Visa’s understanding of its audience, with a 360º profile of the key segments.​

The insights became key drivers in the comms strategy. These gave Visa the ability to plan their campaigns and to develop customised segment-based messaging. The greater level of insight into the Visa customers has increased engagement in communication.​​​
Visa were able to better inform their communications planning thanks to a granular analysis of the motivations and media habits of each segment and media channel. ​

Jenny LovellHead of Insight at eBay
As a global and leading e-retailer and online auction house, eBay has a wide and diverse customer base across many markets and several continents. eBay’s major challenge in the UK was to augment understanding of their users and the changes in their customer base after the pandemic.

eBay’s objective is not only to maintain their existing users but to identify growth opportunities within that customer base.
eBay identified their broad audience and partnered with Kantar Media to profile them via our syndicated consumer insights survey - TGI - the global leading currency for media planning. 

TGI’s holistic consumer insights brought to life eBay’s targets with thousands of data points around shopping habits, lifestyle statements and detailed media behaviours, as well as all the key changes after the pandemic.
TGI profiling unveiled some crucial insights to help shape eBay’s strategy.

These included understanding how important GenZ is for eBay, who are the fastest growing segment since the pandemic and a growth opportunity for eBay. Based on further analysis we were able to deep dive into these younger audiences to understand more about them.

The impact
eBay increased their understanding of the overall eBay user and their 16-34s users, which helped their Brand team have a better view of how to uniquely position eBay to that group.

eBay identified potential growth areas for these new customer acquisition. They were able to tailor their messaging and media campaigns to target and engage with that group.

A detailed analysis of media and creative preferences of these audiences to inform messaging and execution.  
A profile of the media consumption habits of key audiences to optimise the mix of media platforms and properties across paid, owned and earned channels.

Our recommendations and ongoing analysis enabled Cafeyn to achieve its campaign objectives including identifying the top two strategic audiences for the brand to engage and providing rich insight into these audiences in order to inform the development of relevant messaging and branding. 
In addition, Cafeyn was able to optimise their media plans with the optimal mix of paid, earned and owned activity, accurately targeting the audiences based on the media preferences provided by Kantar TGI Consumer Data.

How TGI has helped brands to achieve their growth goals

Providing a deeper understanding of Visa’s customer segments

As one of the world’s largest financial services companies, Visa has a wide and diverse customer base across many markets and several continents.​​
Visa wanted to understand what makes their different groups of customers tick. They wanted to know how close their customers are to Visa’s products, their financial attitudes and their affinity to different payment methods​​
Visa needed data and insights to optimise the relevance of the products  available across different markets in Western Europe and improve their communications and go-to-market strategy.
.
Kantar Media partnered with Visa to map their customer segments to our syndicated consumer insights survey – TGI – the global leading currency for media planning. ​
TGI’s holistic consumer insights enriched Visa’s segment profiles with thousands of new data points around their financial mindset, lifestyle and detailed media behaviours. ​
This connected intelligence approach enhanced Visa’s understanding of its audience, with a 360º profile of the key segments.​

The insights became key drivers in the comms strategy. These gave Visa the ability to plan their campaigns and to develop customised segment-based messaging. The greater level of insight into the Visa customers has increased engagement in communication.​​​
Visa were able to better inform their communications planning thanks to a granular analysis of the motivations and media habits of each segment and media channel. ​

Case study: Samsung

Enhancing addressable Connected TV audience targeting with TGI Consumer Data
Samsung Ads offers advertising solutions built on a unique source of first-party TV data. Their CTV advertising platform enables advertisers to reach and engage with audiences by harnessing powerful insights from over 50 million Samsung Smart TVs across Europe.
Samsung Ads identified the need to complement their first-party data targeting and measurement proposition by overlaying industry-standard addressable audiences in demographic targeting segments.
Agencies commonly use these audiences to construct TV buying audiences that are used for trading and targeting ‘currency’ in Europe, such as BARB audiences in the UK.
Samsung Ads partnered with Kantar Media to enhance their targeting solution for CTV across four European countries, using Kantar Media TGI data. 
The objective of the partnership was to predict the demographic characteristics of Samsung Smart TV viewers without the need to rely on the use of PII data. 
In 2022 we moved the offering from the testing stage to full market availability, thus enabling Samsung Ads to offer an enhanced targeting solution across both branding and performance-based CTV campaigns.
Samsung Ads chose to partner with TGI due to the extensive and detailed nature of their survey data, which is trusted and relied upon across the media industry as the data currency for the buying and selling of advertising. 
Adding to this was Samsung Ads’ determination to provide a privacy-by-design solution. The TGI dataset is a gold standard in GDPR compliance, utilising fully opted-in panelist data. Kantar TGI was a clear choice to align with Samsung’s principles of data compliance. ​

The ability to offer these audiences has enabled Samsung Ads to provide advertisers with a market-leading addressable CTV targeting proposition. This exciting project has provided the groundwork for further matching and scaling between Samsung Ads and Kantar datasets, further enhancing Samsung Ads’ abilities to offer detailed, targeted audience segments via their own market-leading CTV service.

Insights from new questions released more quickly thanks to increased frequency
Fast moving and cyclical behavioural changes can be tracked far more closely

MethodologyMaintaining our best-in-class methodology

The methodology that makes our data so robust and trusted remains largely unchanged with the monthly release schedule:

Sample size: currently 24,000 per year, will remain so with circa 2,000 representative sample monthly
Universe: remains representative sample of adults aged 15+ in Great Britain
Sample source: increase of sample sourced from Kantar online panels from 85% of total to 96%. Separate offline ‘boost’ paper questionnaire introduced to ensure safeguard correct representation of offline populations
Online metered data: Sample of TGI respondents with PC/mobile meters spread evenly across the months
Data weighting: We will continue to weight TGI data by gender, age, government office region, BARB region, Social grade and PAMCo print weights

On GB TGI the measurement of in-depth online and offline behaviour is connected through metered online activity on connected devices. 
This includes comprehensive usage metrics for specific sites and apps, including frequency of visits and time spent.
These metrics make the planning and selling of digital media far more effective for media owners and media agencies.

Feed record-level data from TGI into your first party data
Bespoke connection of your first party data with TGI via modelling partner
A specialist modelling partner creates highly accurate probabilistic models. 


10
Respondent Level Data (RLD) - How we do it
The modelling process
The TGI defined audience is extracted on a record-level basis and shared with the Modelling Partner who will create a model with your 1st Party Data & TGI’s RLD data.​
Based on Modelling Partner’s methodology common behavioural “traits” can be established between your first party data and TGI data. 
Common ‘’traits” will be used to  create a likelihood for every record to sit within a given demographic segment. Each record is scored with a probability of being in any particular demographic segment, based on each records holistic behaviour. 




Define audience profiles using TGI survey





Through TGI's privacy-by-design approach, panellists are 100% permission based  (opt-in) and meet required regulatory data governance e.g. GDPR 

Your first party data will have additional data from TGI dictionary which will stay in the system of your choice with enhanced variables.

Case study: Samsung
Enhancing addressable Connected TV audience targeting with TGI Consumer Data
Samsung Ads offers advertising solutions built on a unique source of first-party TV data. Their CTV advertising platform enables advertisers to reach and engage with audiences by harnessing powerful insights from over 50 million Samsung Smart TVs across Europe.
Samsung Ads identified the need to complement their first-party data targeting and measurement proposition by overlaying industry-standard addressable audiences in demographic targeting segments.
Agencies commonly use these audiences to construct TV buying audiences that are used for trading and targeting ‘currency’ in Europe, such as BARB audiences in the UK.
In 2021 Samsung Ads partnered with Kantar Media to enhance their targeting solution for CTV across four European countries, using Kantar TGI data. 
The objective of the partnership was to predict the demographic characteristics of Samsung Smart TV viewers without the need to rely on the use of PII data. 
In 2022 we moved the offering from the testing stage to full market availability, thus enabling Samsung Ads to offer an enhanced targeting solution across both branding and performance-based CTV campaigns.
Samsung Ads partnered with datafuelX to create probabilistic models by mapping 1st PD to TGI data. 
Samsung Ads chose to partner with TGI due to the extensive and detailed nature of their survey data, which is trusted and relied upon across the media industry as the data currency for the buying and selling of advertising. 
Added to this was Samsung Ads’ determination to provide a privacy-by-design solution. The TGI dataset is a gold standard in GDPR compliance, utilising fully opted-in panelist data. TGI was a clear choice to align with Samsung’s principles of data compliance. ​

The ability to offer these audiences has enabled Samsung Ads to provide advertisers with a market-leading addressable CTV targeting proposition. This exciting project has provided the groundwork for further matching and scaling between Samsung Ads and Kantar datasets, further enhancing Samsung Ads’ abilities to offer detailed, targeted audience segments via their own market-leading CTV service.

Leverage outputs through your own platform, or via ShoWhere visualisation software (see next slide)




A custom audience (e.g. for a particular advertiser) can be generated in 1-3 days and delivered to your account.

Alternatively, we can pre-build a larger range of relevant, thematic audiences that you require for ongoing use.

There also exists a pre-built taxonomy comprising circa 100 high value TGI audiences ready for geo-targeting (see Appendix for more).
23

TGI Geo Affinities: Selection and configuration options 
Pre-built & custom audiences

We maintain a library of circa 100 pre-built popular audiences that can be accessed for ‘always-on’ use within a 12-month licence period.

Additionally, custom audiences (per campaign) can be created on-demand and delivered to your account on a ‘per-audience’ fee basis.


Data-only or data and dashboard

Analysing segments via the ShoWhere dashboard is a compelling interface for audience management and exporting for any/all users.

However, we also have options to deliver data-files direct to your chosen end-points (e.g. A3 bucket) and can offer this file-only approach.

Glossary
1st Party Data: First party data is data your company has collected directly from your audience, whether customer, site visitors, or social media followers.

3rd Party Data: Third-party data is information collected by a provider across other company's websites, apps, registrations, etc. The provider gathers this data from several businesses with no direct relationship with the customer.

Activation: Using data sets to directly target advertising to specific groups more effectively.

Ad exchange: Digital marketplace where buyers and sellers come together and enter into a real-time bidding process to buy and sell ad space.

Data modelling: the process of creating a visual representation of either a whole information system or parts of it to communicate connections between data points and structures.

Deterministic: Use of anonymised log-in data or hashed email addresses, to match and recognise individuals on device they may be using. This is authenticated data; hence the match is made with 100% certainty.

DMP: A data management platform collects, organizes, and activates first-, second-, and third-party audience data from various online, offline, and mobile sources. 

DSP: A demand-side platform is software that allows an advertiser to buy inventory from ad exchanges and manage advertising campaigns.

Enrichment: Adding selected data/insights into your own solutions to help you better understand your customers. Adding additional layers of knowledge about them such as their lifestyle, attitudes and media preferences. 

Geo Affinities modelling: Modelling consumer affinity at different geographic levels.

IDs: a unique number that is generated by the publisher's supply-side platform (or an ad server) for programmatic direct deals.

Permissioned segments: TGI already have permission questions and partner agreements in place to link these TGI data sets into partner platforms for the purpose of activation.

Probabilistic: Use of anonymised data based on TGI data by postcode location to create likely statistical connections with National Statistics Office census data by postcode. Probabilistic matching achieves greater scale..

Programmatic campaigns: Buying digital advertising space automatically, with computers using data to decide which ads to buy and how much to pay for them, often in real time.

Record Level Data (RLD): A record that contains unique and nonaggregate data elements that relate to a single identifiable individual or provider.

SSP: Supply-side platforms connect publishers to multiple demand sources at the same time in a programmatic marketplace. SSPs provide the technology and resources enabling publishers to aggregate, consolidate, and manage their demand sources. Publishers set brand safety guidelines, categories, and pricing.
MAID: Mobile Ad ID is a sequence of random symbols, given by the mobile device’s operating system.

Segmentation Overview
Europa 2024 R2

The persistent need for human contact and tangible experiences
•Consumer confidence in banks and financial institutions has 
come a long way since the 2008 financial crisis. It improved 
particularly during the pandemic.  
•Nevertheless, it is showing potential fresh signs of erosion  
due to the cost -of-living crisis and rising interest rates. 
•Meanwhile, the gap between consumer intent to be well 
insured and actually taking out  insurance remains wide. 
•In this context Kantar Media has segmented adults in 
Europe according to five main dimensions: risk aversion, 
willingness to pay extra for goods, financial understanding, 
budget constraints and preference for digital banking.
•The result is five distinct consumer groups with each 
showing scope for financial services penetration.•The segments are also differentiated by their attitudes 
towards digital versus cash payment , as well as their trust 
in banks and financial institutions. 
•Some older segments show greater preference for 
cashless payment and digital transactions while one of the 
young segments values cash and human reassurance much 
more than the average . 
•While all the segments have commercial potential, two in 
particular show promise for retail banks and insurers . 
•This report focuses on the GB market. The segments are also 
available in Germany, Spain & France. While their overall 
profile is consistent, their sizes vary by country and they reveal 
specific traits within individual countries . Main findings

In my world, there's room for both the digital and the 
physical . Of course, I use my digital wallet, and I'd even 
consider using bitcoin.  But at the end of the day, it’s still 
essential to have real cash. Relying on smooth online 
services is essential. However, more than anyone else , I 
value the reassurance of a financial expert; human 
interactions matter to me and I trust banks and 
financial companies . 
That's not to say that I don't trust purely digital players - 
both have their place. I've become much more aware of 
my personal finances. I have materialistic aspirations and 
I'm open to different financial solutions to meet them. I’d 
like to say I am managing my money well, but I think I 
could do better. I look for profitable way to invest my 
money but I am not comfortable with too much risk

I live comfortably on my income and I am generally willing 
to pay more for premium goods. I am very good at 
managing my money on a daily basis and I live within my 
means. Before spending on a big outlay I think about it for 
while, I also look to the future, as I see a comfortable 
retirement as my own responsibility.  
I agree it’s important to be insured for everything, but 
I have not yet taken steps to get life insurance or health 
insurance. I frequently use online banking services and I 
am not very attached to cash . But overall I do not feel 
terribly knowledgeable or proactive about finance. I do 
have some investments but I lean towards the least risky

Minimum sample size is 1,059 respondents, full detail in final slidePrefer traditional financial methods, for example they are more likely to use cash and have less trust in using purely online  banks. They tend to be 
cautious with their finances and like to have a control over their spend. They are lower on the socio -economic scale, falling be low average when talking 
about comfort on present income. They are not particularly keen on seeking financial advice despite having lower levels of fi nancial literacy. Their financial 
proactiveness is average. 
Most trust in banks, are proactive and place a lot of emphasis on seeking financial advice, even though they view themselves as knowledgeable in this 
field. They have average levels of financial comfort - and whilst they are more likely than other groups to want to control thei r spending within  certain 
categories, they are also most likely to pay for extras when they perceive it’s worth it. Open to both the use of cash and di gital payment methods, they see 
online banking as a basic expectation, while many value in -person services.  They are more likely to have personal loans and pri vate health insurance.
Very knowledgeable and proactive about finance - and feel comfortable with modern methods, preferring to use digital payments an d more likely to hold 
trust in purely online financial institutions. They are well above average when it comes to holding investments. They are ver y comfortable on their present 
income and tend towards  a high socio -economic grade - as such, they don’t have any particularly strong desire to carefully control their spending. They  
are more likely to use a variety of financial solutions, with the exception of personal loans. 
Very financially comfortable, found in the high socio -economic grades - and will often pay more for extras.  They are no more or less likely than others to 
interact with financial services, but they tend to be risk -averse with moderate trust in banks and purely online institutions, e ven though they tend to prefer 
making transactions online. They are indifferent when it comes to seeking financial advice and are in line with the wider pop ulation for mortgages and loans – 
and slightly less likely to hold investments than others. They are more likely to say they want to be well insured, but this is not reflected in their action. 
This group feels  financial pressures, but despite this, is fairly impulsive when it comes to spending. Some are likely to have several loans a t any one time 
and prefer to pay digitally. In general, they are disinterested in financial matters, with both their financial literacy and proactiveness below average. They 
don’t place much faith in financial institutions, with low levels of trust in either banks or purely online players, as well as being unlikely to seek any form of 
financial advice or guidance.

Personal Guidance Seekers
In my world, there's room for both the digital and the physical. Of course, I use my digital wallet, and I'd even consider using bitcoin.  But at the end of the day, it’s still essential to have real cash. Relying on smooth online services is essential. However, more than anyone else, I value the reassurance of a financial expert; human interactions matter to me and I trust banks and financial companies. 

That's not to say that I don't trust purely digital players - both have their place. I've become much more aware of my personal finances. I have materialistic aspirations and I'm open to different financial solutions to meet them. I’d like to say I am managing my money well, but I think I could do better. I look for profitable way to invest my money but I am not comfortable with too much risk

Uncertain Affluent Customers

”
I live comfortably on my income and I am generally willing to pay more for premium goods. I am very good at managing my money on a daily basis and I live within my means. Before spending on a big outlay I think about it for while, I also look to the future, as I see a comfortable retirement as my own responsibility. 

I agree it’s important to be insured for everything, but I have not yet taken steps to get life insurance or health insurance. I frequently use online banking services and I am not very attached to cash. But overall I do not feel terribly knowledgeable or proactive about finance. I do have some investments but I lean towards the least risky

‘Personal Guidance Seekers’ spend less time on desktop internet than outdoor. The reverse is true for ‘Uncertain Affluent Consumers’.

Financial Segment Characteristics
Source: Europa TGI R1 2024, Base = All Adults
Minimum sample size is 1,059 respondents, full detail in final slide
Prefer traditional financial methods, for example they are more likely to use cash and have less trust in using purely online banks. They tend to be cautious with their finances and like to have a control over their spend. They are lower on the socio-economic scale, falling below average when talking about comfort on present income. They are not particularly keen on seeking financial advice despite having lower levels of financial literacy. Their financial proactiveness is average. 
Most trust in banks, are proactive and place a lot of emphasis on seeking financial advice, even though they view themselves as knowledgeable in this field. They have average levels of financial comfort - and whilst they are more likely than other groups to want to control their spending within certain categories, they are also most likely to pay for extras when they perceive it’s worth it. Open to both the use of cash and digital payment methods, they see online banking as a basic expectation, while many value in-person services.  They are more likely to have personal loans and private health insurance.
Very knowledgeable and proactive about finance - and feel comfortable with modern methods, preferring to use digital payments and more likely to hold trust in purely online financial institutions. They are well above average when it comes to holding investments. They are very comfortable on their present income and tend towards a high socio-economic grade - as such, they don’t have any particularly strong desire to carefully control their spending. They are more likely to use a variety of financial solutions, with the exception of personal loans. 
Very financially comfortable, found in the high socio-economic grades - and will often pay more for extras.  They are no more or less likely than others to interact with financial services, but they tend to be risk-averse with moderate trust in banks and purely online institutions, even though they tend to prefer making transactions online. They are indifferent when it comes to seeking financial advice and are in line with the wider population for mortgages and loans – and slightly less likely to hold investments than others. They are more likely to say they want to be well insured, but this is not reflected in their action. 
This group feels financial pressures, but despite this, is fairly impulsive when it comes to spending. Some are likely to have several loans at any one time and prefer to pay digitally. In general, they are disinterested in financial matters, with both their financial literacy and proactiveness below average. They don’t place much faith in financial institutions, with low levels of trust in either banks or purely online players, as well as being unlikely to seek any form of financial advice or guidance.

equal-sized groups based on their level of consumption of that medium. The
resulting groups range from the top 20% (heaviest consumers) to the bottom
20% (lightest consumers). Those who do not consume the medium at all are
consigned to a separate group of non-consumers. MNQs represent an easy-to-

from improving campaign efficiency by pinpointing the best media mix, to
building a compelling sales argument for a specific medium over others.Comparable measures for effective

The comprehensive coverage of sporting events
and teams on TGI Sport+ combined with the sheer
breadth and depth of consumer insight on the TGI
survey makes it easy for marketers to identify
sponsorship opportunities. This information is
invaluable for informing rights holders, sporting
bodies and advertisers on the right brand fit. Identifying sports sponsorship opportunities 
Getting the sponsorship activation right For example, those who follow motor rallying are
an extremely lucrative audience for tyre
manufacturers and account for a significant
proportion all tyre buyers in Britain. However, the
brands of tyres bought by rally fans are different to
those bought by the public at large. 
TGI Sport+ has comprehensive coverage of above
and below-the-line media, including consumption
from the macro to the micro (brand) level. This
level of detail is crucial when trying to ‘activate’ a
sponsorship and promote the fact that Brand X is
sponsoring Event Y. Not only is weight of media usage measured, but also
specific attitudes to - and engagement with - media
and advertising, allowing the exact nature of the
sponsorship message to be finely honed to achieve
maximum efficiency amongst the target audience.

kantarmedia.comBrand Value Seekers
Shopping habits revolve around
assessing product quality and
seeking value via special offers or
other promotion incentives. Whilst
they like a low price, they will not
choose it at the expense of quality.
Trend Focused
Active in the consumer community
and fascinated by fashion and
trends. Tend to be less proactive in
choosing food and groceries,
suggesting these categories are not a
priority for them. Skewed towards a
younger demographic.
Prudent Purchasers
Purely focused on saving money
when shopping. Not drawn into any
consumerism and show little concern
for the environment. Skewed towards
older low-income households.
Product and Sustainability First
Priorities lie in the quality and
sustainability of their purchases.
Inclined to seek items that are
premium, local, organic,
environmental, ethical etc. 
Skew towards older, high-income
households – half of which are retired.Necessity Buyers
Not particularly fond of the shopping
experience and less materialistic.
They seek speed and efficiency to
cater to their busy lifestyle. Skewed
towards younger demographics.
Socially Influenced consumers
Fully engaged with consumerism,
particularly mindful of their social status
and image within the community. Show
extensive engagement with social media,
reviews, advertising and marketing.
Likely to be relatively young.
Comfort Driven
Shopping habits adapted around a more
slow-paced lifestyle. Like to seek out what
makes things easiest for them, which
often leads to online shopping. They tend
to have a more traditional lifestyle and are
skewed towards being older and retired.Understanding the grocery purchasing habits of consumers is key to better
targeting of specific types of shopper. Our TGI FMCG Shopper archetypes split
the grocery shopper population into seven key, clearly articulated groups.TGI FMCG Shopper Archetypes

Understanding TGI Worldpanel
1
What is TGI Worldpanel?
3
Exploiting the breadth and depth of TGI’s consumer behaviour data against Worldpanel’s detailed purchase data
Kantar Worldpanel are specialists in measuring and collating actual shopper purchase information.
TGI data provides claimed in-depth insight into all aspects of consumer behaviour and characteristics: demographic, attitudinal, leisure, media consumption.


Detailed, category-level insight on actual product purchases

Identify possible new markets, emerging trends and product opportunities

Assess brand usage data within the context of the vast array of TGI profiling metrics (media, lifestyle and behavioural)

TGI
Worldpanel
The fusion
4
Constrained fusion – respondents put into sub-records which are then paired to match exactly on gender and region.
Paired records are chosen based on a set of variables common to both datasets. Those with the strongest relationship to selected key variables available on just one dataset are retained
This means when key variables are analysed against each other in the merged database, a reliable result is ensured.
Bringing together TGI and Worldpanel data – Worldpanel data is fused on to TGI data (main shoppers only)

Rule #1
TGI Worldpanel must only be used for media planning of FMCG products
Using the data
7
Three key rules
Any analysis which can be run within the standard TGI or Worldpanel datasets should be done within these
3
Avoid running data trends on Worldpanel-only variables
2
Do not run Worldpanel items against other Worldpanel items

Differentiating datasets in the dictionary

Ensuring you always look at data drawn from both TGI and Worldpanel

Note: example above is from choices software
Choosing the right mix of variables
9
Always compare TGI with Worldpanel variables in any crosstab
In the below, both variables in the crosstab are from Worldpanel. This should only be run in the Worldpanel database, NOT TGI Worldpanel
In the below, the row variable in the crosstab is from TGI data and the column variable is from Worldpanel. The data is therefore accurate.

16
Reading spend data correctly
Here we can see that those who go to a private gym more than once a week (heavy users) have seen total household spend of  £442,422,000 at Sainsbury’s over a 12 month period
Note: Horizontal percentage here does not show a figure of any value for spend


Factoring

Factoring
18
The Worldpanel component of the merged database contains no part-period data.
Be aware – The two individual databases do not refer to the same calendar periods, thus:
Building the correct analysis
Targets combining TGI and Worldpanel elements should not be factored up if part-period in the TGI data – instead, a relevant fieldwork period can be applied as a base
2
Targets combining TGI and Worldpanel elements cannot be used to assess penetration changes between quarters

Case study: Samsung

Enhancing addressable Connected TV audience targeting with TGI Consumer Data
Samsung Ads offers advertising solutions built on a unique source of first-party TV data. Their CTV advertising platform enables advertisers to reach and engage with audiences by harnessing powerful insights from over 50 million Samsung Smart TVs across Europe.
Samsung Ads identified the need to complement their first-party data targeting and measurement proposition by overlaying industry-standard addressable audiences in demographic targeting segments.
Agencies commonly use these audiences to construct TV buying audiences that are used for trading and targeting ‘currency’ in Europe, such as BARB audiences in the UK.
Samsung Ads partnered with Kantar Media to enhance their targeting solution for CTV across four European countries, using Kantar Media TGI data. 
The objective of the partnership was to predict the demographic characteristics of Samsung Smart TV viewers without the need to rely on the use of PII data. 
In 2022 we moved the offering from the testing stage to full market availability, thus enabling Samsung Ads to offer an enhanced targeting solution across both branding and performance-based CTV campaigns.
Samsung Ads chose to partner with TGI due to the extensive and detailed nature of their survey data, which is trusted and relied upon across the media industry as the data currency for the buying and selling of advertising. 
Adding to this was Samsung Ads’ determination to provide a privacy-by-design solution. The TGI dataset is a gold standard in GDPR compliance, utilising fully opted-in panelist data. Kantar TGI was a clear choice to align with Samsung’s principles of data compliance. ​

The ability to offer these audiences has enabled Samsung Ads to provide advertisers with a market-leading addressable CTV targeting proposition. This exciting project has provided the groundwork for further matching and scaling between Samsung Ads and Kantar datasets, further enhancing Samsung Ads’ abilities to offer detailed, targeted audience segments via their own market-leading CTV service.

About TGI Media Neutral Quintiles
TGI’s Media Neutral Quintiles (MNQs) split consumers of each medium into five 
equal-sized groups based on their level of consumption of that medium. The resulting 
groups range from the top 20% (heaviest consumers) to the bottom 20% (lightest 
consumers). Those who do not consume the medium at all are consigned to a separate  
group of non-consumers. MNQs represent an easy-to-use and comparable set of media  
measurements which have a number of uses, from improving campaign efficiency by 
pinpointing the best media mix, to building a compelling sales argument for a specific 
medium over others.

About TGI Social DNA
Inspired by the work of celebrated French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, who championed 
the understanding of human behaviour through the twin subconscious drivers of  
economic and cultural ‘capital’, our segmentation comprises nine separate groups,  
encompassing every combination (low, medium, high) of these two key drivers.
About the segments

from TGI metrics in the following areas:

and influence on a particular product or subject. It comprises three strands:

likely to be discussed with friends and family on a day-to-day basis.

About TGI Europa Net
Europa Net 20R1
TGI Net Europa is an online survey that collects information on internet behaviours in France, Germany, Great Britain and Spain - and which also connects to the wider base of insight available across TGI’s Europa study.
The study itself provides a range of data on Internet usage, online purchase behaviours, attitudes towards the Internet (purchase, advertising etc.) as well as detailed website visitation figures. 
TGI Net Europa study also allows users to analyse this same data across the full range of available consumer and media metrics of the main Europa TGI.
The Europa Net database enables rapid comparisons to be made between countries, demographic groups and categories of users or media vehicles.  It can also be used to readily create more sophisticated groups and targets based on the widest range of subscriber needs.

The TGI Questionnaire

Coverage
Europa Net 20R1
Questions are designed to establish the respondent’s use/ownership of products and/or services and participation in activities.

EuropaNet is an online survey focused on Internet behaviour. The questionnaire is about 36 minutes long. 
Product and brand information in the TGI is based on numbers of users. Caution should therefore be exercised in comparing it with estimates of market size and brand share from other sources, such as retail audit information.

Data Fusion
4
Data Fusion
The TGI Net Europa database is created by the standalone Internet Behaviour data on to the related TGI Europa survey-sample using a technique known as constrained fusion. 
Constrained fusion takes account of the weighting in the donor dataset and is used where there is a need to retain the donor results. Data fusion operates by matching respondents at an individual record level, and then passing all the data from a Donor record to a matching Recipient record.
Constrained fusion involves splitting both Donor respondents (from Internet Behaviour sub-section) and Recipient respondents (from TGI) into weighted sub-records. These sub-records are then paired to match exactly on country, age and gender. In addition, for each TGI recipient record, the paired donor record is chosen based on a set of variables which are common to both datasets (hooks). 
The fusion process also uses the record weights to ensure full usage of the data from both weighted databases.
Europa Net 20R1
Europa Net 20R1
Back to Contents
14
Europa Net 20R1
With constrained fusion, all Donor respondents and all Recipient respondents contribute to the final fused dataset in proportion to their respondent weights, ensuring a very close match between the two original source databases and the final fused database.
Only TGI respondents who used internet in the last month are used as recipients.
D: Data for the 2,000 respondents is modelled (using constrained fusion) on to the c. 9,000 internet users in the TGI sample.
ES: Data for the 2,000 respondents is modelled (using constrained fusion) on to the c.8,000 internet users in the TGI sample.
F: Data for the 2,000 respondents is modelled (using constrained fusion) on to the c.14,000 internet users in the TGI sample.
GB: Data for around 6000 respondents who answered the net survey are fused on to c.20,000 internet users in the TGI sample

Part-Period Data

5
Data measured for part of the year – what you need to know
Europa Net 20R1
The Changes Flags continue to be displayed in analysis tools such as Choices, allowing users to identify which data are modelled so that appropriate caution can be taken during analysis.


The tool used to create such modelling works by multiple data imputations being performed, using hook variables to identify the most appropriate donor on a granular scale down to individual data points.

A recipient typically receives data from multiple donors allowing for a high degree of control over the modelling process.

Imputation of Part-Period Data
The Europa Net 2020R1 database will contain imputed part-year TGI and TGI Net data where it is missing due to wave-on-wave fieldwork changes. The result being the elimination of the need for clients to apply scaling factors to part-year data.

Since TGI and TGI Net questionnaires change regularly, any 12 months release of a TGI net database contains respondents who completed different versions (waves) of the questionnaire. 


Where new questions and answers have been added (as indicated by part-period Changes Flags), this new data has been modelled onto those respondents who completed the questionnaire prior to the additions.

Data measured for part of the year – what you need to know
Europa 20R1 – All Countries
The tool used to create such modelling uses a machine learning technique. 


For each individual part-period variable, the algorithm selects the best predictor variables, and uses them to generate a probability model which is then used to impute data for each respondent. 


With this technique, all important relationships between the target variable and its best predictors are replicated from the training (donor) data set into the recipient data set.

The Europa 2020R1 database will contain imputed part-year TGI data where it is missing due to wave-on-wave fieldwork changes. The result being the elimination of the need for clients to apply scaling factors to part-year data.
Since TGI questionnaires change regularly, any 12 months release of a TGI database contains respondents who completed different versions (waves) of the questionnaire. 

Where new questions and answers have been added (as indicated by part-period Changes Flags), this new data has been modelled onto those respondents who completed the questionnaire prior to the additions. 

The Changes Flags continue to be displayed in analysis tools such as Choices, allowing users to identify which data are modelled so that appropriate caution can be taken during analysis.

Rotations
Though Spain database will contain information for all the sections year on year, questions covering certain products and brands are rotated in the Spanish questionnaire and will only be asked in alternate years. Where questions are not asked, data has been fused from the previous year’s release. This is done applying a “constrained fusion” method, where individual donors (used only once) and recipients are split into sub-records, each with a weight attached. These are then matched on hook variables and the weighting factor. The effect is to try to more closely retain weighted results from both databases.
Certain questions and some full sectors are asked every year (i.e. will not rotate). These are Media, demographic data, Attitudinal statements, Decision criteria questions and certain key products from different sectors.

Only those people who are Housewives/husbands are required to answer Food, drink & household products of the questionnaire, meaning the length of the questionnaire will vary depending on the role of the interviewee.

Video subscription engagement especially strong in the AmericasWe asked consumers if they were faced with an unexpected expense, which one specific product, service or experience they would prioritise (e.g. holiday, outing, hobbies, clothes).Those who indicated that they would prioritise their online TV/video subscription service varies by region, indicating the depth of engagement with such services.In North America consumers are almost twice as likely as the average adult globally to prioritise their streaming services, whereas in APAC they are over 50% less likely to do so. % more/less likely than average adult to prioritise spend on TV/video subscription in the event of an unexpected expense62%95%

Understanding the key criteria for selecting a video streaming service for specific target groups offers considerable opportunities for campaign optimisation.Cost leads the top criteria when choosing a paid TV/video streaming service to subscribe to.However, it is far from the only prominent factor influencing subscription decisions.The heaviest users of paid video streaming viewing are particularly likely compared to the average user of paid video streaming services to have specific criteria that they hold dear when choosing a service to subscribe to – see over.Paid video subscription criteria led by cost, but priorities differ by target group

…however, big differences in video streaming ad engagement by marketsIn more established Western markets, these differences are typically less pronounced than in emerging markets. We can see this in the case of Germany where the most affluent consumers are only very slightly more likely to engage with advertising on streaming services.
Conversely, in India, the heaviest paid video streaming viewers and the most affluent consumers are far more likely than the average paid video streaming user globally to engage with advertising on streaming services.Understanding where the most valuable consumers engage most with advertising is key to optimising campaign efficiency – see over.

Content preference differences by market enable targeting opportunitiesContent providers and other brands need to understand which types of TV and video content are particularly sought after in which parts of the world in order to ensure the right resource is set against demand and consumers are at less risk of becoming disengaged. We measure engagement with almost 40 different genres of TV programmes and films.Whilst overall the most popular TV genres are movies and comedy, there are considerable differences between regions and markets – see over.

Identifying favoured TV genres on platforms can boost targeting opportunitiesWe’ve seen in the previous slide how consumers in North America are particularly likely to enjoy drama as a TV genre.Consumer targeting can be further refined by understanding which specific video streaming services those who want to see more drama within certain markets in this region are especially likely to use.For example, TGI Global Quick View shows us that in the USA those who use the Showtime streaming service are particularly likely to say they want to see more drama, whereas for Disney+ users the desire for more of this genre is significantly lower – see over.

TikTok and Snapchat are valuable ad platforms for reaching consumersIt is important not to let audience biases and assumptions impact campaigns. Some marketers may assume certain social platforms, like TikTok and Snapchat, are only useful for reaching the youngest consumers. However, TGI shows that TikTok sees similar usage across age ranges – it is by no means just the preserve of the young.Snapchat has a younger profile but nevertheless almost two-thirds of its users are over the age of 25 - see over.

We asked consumers to score their linear vs. non-linear viewing on a seven-point scale.
We can see here the sharp rise in those stating that most of their viewing is non-linear – no doubt accelerated by pandemic lockdowns and the growing availability of video streaming platforms.

Globally, 83% of adults claim to use a paid video streaming service. 
While 93% claim to use a free service.
Campaign efficiency within video streaming is achieved through understanding where video streaming engagement is greatest
Typically, in more mature, largely Western markets, significantly more time is spent watching paid than free video streaming. 
In more emerging markets the split is far more even – see over.

Time spent on paid* vs free video streaming services reveals key fluctuations

Video subscription engagement especially strong in the Americas
We asked consumers if they were faced with an unexpected expense, which one specific product, service or experience they would prioritise (e.g. holiday, outing, hobbies, clothes).
Those who indicated that they would prioritise their online TV/video subscription service varies by region, indicating the depth of engagement with such services.
In North America consumers are almost twice as likely as the average adult globally to prioritise their streaming services, whereas in APAC they are over 50%less likely to do so.

Understanding the key criteria for selecting a video streaming service for specific target groups offers considerable opportunities for campaign optimisation.
Cost leads the top criteria when choosing a paid TV/video streaming service to subscribe to.
However, it is far from the only prominent factor influencing subscription decisions.
The heaviest users of paid video streaming viewing are particularly likely compared to the average user of paid video streaming services to have specific criteria that they hold dear when choosing a service to subscribe to – see over.

Heavy paid video streaming users and affluent consumers more likely to engage with advertising
TV and video streaming providers can optimise promotion of their services by pointing to the fact that both heavy users of paid video streaming and the most affluent consumers are significantly more likely than the average paid video streaming user to accept and engage with advertising within a streaming service.

Base: All users of paid VOD services

…however, big differences in video streaming ad engagement by markets
In more established Western markets, these differences are typically less pronounced than in emerging markets. 
We can see this in the case of Germany where the most affluent consumers are only very slightly more likely to engage with advertising on streaming services.

Conversely, in India, the heaviest paid video streaming viewers and the most affluent consumers are far more likely than the average paid video streaming user globally to engage with advertising on streaming services.

Understanding where the most valuable consumers engage most with advertising is key to optimising campaign efficiency – see over.

Content preference differences by market enable targeting opportunities
Content providers and other brands need to understand which types of TV and video content are particularly sought after in which parts of the world in order to ensure the right resource is set against demand and consumers are at less risk of becoming disengaged. 
We measure engagement with almost 40 different genres of TV programmes and films.
Whilst overall the most popular TV genres are movies and comedy, there are considerable differences between regions and markets – see over.
16

Content preference differences by market enable targeting opportunities
TV programme genres wish to see more of
In Latin America consumers are particularly likely to wish to see more soap operas on TV, whereas in North America consumers are more likely to clamour for drama and in APAC there is particular interest in news and current affairs.
17
Identifying favoured TV genres on platforms can boost targeting opportunities
We’ve seen in the previous slide how consumers in North America are particularly likely to enjoy drama as a TV genre.
Consumer targeting can be further refined by understanding which specific video streaming services those who want to see more drama within certain markets in this region are especially likely to use.
For example, TGI Global Quick View shows us that in the USA those who use the Showtime streaming service are particularly likely to say they want to see more drama, whereas for Disney+ users the desire for more of this genre is significantly lower – see over.

Optimising opportunities on social platforms
Social media has a significant impact on video streaming adoption in many countries
In many markets, what is trending on social media can have a profound impact on the video streaming services consumers subscribe to, as the next slide reveals.

But how can key consumer audiences be identified and engaged on social platforms more widely?

In this section we explore global opportunities for social engagement.

TikTok and Snapchat are valuable ad platforms for reaching consumers
It is important not to let audience biases and assumptions impact campaigns. Some marketers may assume certain social platforms, like TikTok and Snapchat, are only useful for reaching the youngest consumers. 
However, TGI shows that TikTok sees similar usage across age ranges – it is by no means just the preserve of the young.
Snapchat has a younger profile but nevertheless almost two-thirds of its users are over the age of 25 - see over.

Understand the off-the-scale changes in consumer behaviour due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fully-harmonised international dataset (i.e. same questionnaire) in 25 major advertising markets with 67,000+ interviews and representative samples of their online populations (ranging from 1,500 to 6,000 surveyed consumers). 25 countries in 2020: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France Germany, Great Britain, Mainland China, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, India, Indonesia, Italy, Poland, Russia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Turkey, USA 
The international view on digital consumer behaviour provided by TGI Global Quick View directly guides to local market insights (and vice-versa) through the application of common consumer segmentation, which are also available in all other TGI Country Datasets as points of reference.
In-depth understanding of what defines connected consumers, their digital media consumption and e-commerce / online purchase and brand preferences.
It provides insights on how consumers have changed behaviour due to the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to their media habits and frequency, as well as statements on the changes in their activities and attitudes as a result of the impact of the virus.
It allows clients to ‘sense’ the digital maturity of a market and analyse the case for looking deeper using TGI Country Datasets.
Data is accessed through TGI Consumer Analysis tools. Kantar recommendation is to analyse the data with the data visualisation web-based tool TGI Snapshot, although it can be delivered via TGI Choices Online for use cases where a crosstab analysis of the data is required and even be integrated in client third-party platforms.
TGI Global Quick View is a international harmonised dataset on the connected consumer that enables clients to take international strategic decisions based on evidence from the world’s largest economies. It is marketed in conjunction with TGI Country Datasets, which enables the activation of the insights and audience profiles provided by TGI Global Quick View.
The platform of choice for the dataset is TGI Snapshot, as the best web-based app for quick insights on multi-country data.

Clients pay a single fee for subscription to the data and platform (up to 5 users). The data is also accessible through TGI Choices Online or through integration into client’s own platforms (at an additional cost). 
TGI Global Quick View’s competitive advantage is based on the combination of the dataset with TGI Country Datasets. While the objective is to sale access to multiple datasets to clients, TGI Global Quick View may be sold as an entry point to Kantar Media’s Consumer Intelligence offering, with TGI Country Datasets being an upsale in in the sales journey for clients.

FAQs [Frequently Asked Questions by Customers]
PRODUCT QUESTIONS
Does TGI Global Quick View have information on local media and brands?
TGI Global Quick View provides a headline perspective on a number of key categories – and, for the most part, is therefore focussed on major international brands or the most important local/regional entities. Further information on the brand-lists is available from the Product Team.

What is the frequency of each fieldwork wave?
TGI Global Quick View data is collected in a single wave over the course of 2 months and released once a year. 

Is it possible to add countries and content themes to the dataset?
For 2018, the coverage and content of TGI Global Quick View has now been finalised. Prior to the 2019 running of the study, the Product Team will consult with Markets on areas for potential further development

Is it possible to replicate targets built on one dataset (TGI Global Quick View) to others (TGI Country Datasets?)
A number of common demographic and psychographic segmentations have been added to both Global Sensor and to the TGI Country Datasets. This will  provide clients with common targets and bases that can be carried through both their international and local insight activities.

In many markets around the world gaming is now 
bigger than the film and music industries combined 
and saw even further dramatic growth during the 
pandemic as consumers were stuck at home  
during lockdown.
Even the word ‘gaming’ today can cover a multitude 
of different practices, from the most ‘hardcore’ 
console gamers, to those who dip in and out on  
their mobile.Marketers are keen to leverage the potential riches 
of this sector by understanding who engages with 
gaming today, how this differs by market and ways 
in which they might best be engaged.
Through our 2021 TGI Global Quick View consumer 
data, which explores consumer characteristics, 
behaviour and media consumption – harmonised 
across 35 markets worldwide – we explore five key 
trends in gaming around the world today.KEY GAMING

When it comes to the heaviest gamers –  
those playing 5 hours or more per day – 
although Asian and Middle Eastern markets 
including Saudi Arabia and Philippines still

1. Background  
TGI Global Quick View helps global companies to identify the digital media consumption and 
purchase preferences of their target audiences at an international level.  
 
By providing a ful ly-harmonised international dataset in 2 5 major advertising markets, TGI 
Global Quick View is of value to a wide range of companies including Media & Rights 
Owners, Media & Creative Agencies and Brand owners. The international view on digital 
consumer beha viour allows users to do the following:   
 
• To monitor global trends in digital media consumption and profile audiences across 
markets  
• To answer globally -focused planning briefs with consistent international target -group 
data 
• To identify business opportuni ties based on global consumer trends  
 
As a complement to the international view of connected consumers provided by TGI Global 
Quick View, subscribers to TGI Country Data Sets can also mine our local planning 
databases for more in -depth intelligence into the local composition of their global target 
audiences.

Sample size = 6 7,262  
Fieldwork period = March – May 2020  
Weighted universe = 9 30 million weekly internet users aged 16 -65 
Recruitment methodologies = online panel  
Survey methodologies = online self -completion  
Weighting sources = local TGI, UN World Population Prospects 201 9, Internet 
World Stats and local market census

3. The  TGI Global Quick View sample and universe  
The 20 20 release relates to fieldwork conducted between March and May . The sample 
collected during this time equates to 67,262 u sables survey responses from 16 -65 year olds 
who use the internet for leisure purpose s at least weekly.  
 
The database consists of interviews conducted in 2 5 markets around the world. In the majority 
of markets, the sample represents all geographies within the country. However, in the following 
markets the sample represents urban population s: Argentina, Brazil, China ( Tiers 1 -4), India, 
Mexico  and Russia . 
 
Once weighted, TGI Global Quick View represents the behaviours and attitudes of a little over 
930 million people.  
 
 
 
4. Questionnaire administration and recruitment methodology  
The TGI Global Quick View questionnaire was administered in to respondents as an online 
self-completion survey .  
 
The questionnaire itself is split into three parts. All respondents completed the core, 65% of 
those went on to complete part 2 and 55% of those that complete core, went on to complete 
part 3.  Respondents either only completed core or core and part 2, or core, part 2 and part 3.  
 
The questionnaire was  designed to collect data on the following areas:  
 
Single source  core  
 
1. General digital behaviours and preferences  
2. Usage of digital media services  
3. Attitudes and demographics to define various personality and identity classifications  
4. Offline behaviours  
 
 
Additional  parts covered  
 
1. Purchase categories (online and offline), and usage of global brands in key ca tegories  
2. Sports following and interest  
3. Leisure activities  
4. Impact of Coronavirus on behaviours and attitudes  
 
 
 
In certain markets, the study was also available to be taken in multiple languages to increase 
participation and further ensure a representative sample:  
 
Market  Languages available  
Canada  English [Canada], French [Canada]  
Belgium  Dutch [Belgium ], French , German

Online fieldwork  
For all online fieldwork, Profiles  acted as fieldwork supplier using either their own consumer 
panel in whole , or in combination with verified panel partners.  The questionnaire is divided into 
3 parts , the length of interview differed for each stage, however, the length of interview  for 
each part  was kept below 20 minutes in all markets to ensure data quality throughout.  
  
 
 
 
5. Sampling  
The sampling was based on quotas generated from  local TGI, UN World Population Prospects 
2019, Internet World Stats and local market census to ensure data  was representative of 
weekly internet users for leisure in each market. Quotas were applied to:  
 
• Age x gender  
• Internet frequency (Daily, Week ly)  
• Local region or city  
 
Internet frequency was achieved where possible, with quotas being flexible where appropriate 
to achieve total sample.  
 
 
 
6. Quality controls  
Quality controls were put in place which  resulted in an average of 7% of completes being  
disqualified.

7. Weighting  
Weights were applied at a local level to ensure the final profile matched the quota proportions 
for age, gender , internet frequency and city/region. The weights were then grossed to 
represent the population estimates for each market.  
 
To achieve this sever al sources of data were used:  
 
- United Nations World Population Prospects 201 9   
- AIMC 2019  
- TGI GB 19Q4  
- TGI Europa 2019r2  
- TGI Turkey 2019r2

Local TGI data was used in order to ensure nationally representative data. Where a market 
did not have a local TGI, the census w as used to ensure sampling was representative in age 
x gender , and regions.  
 
 
6 
 
Last week internet penetration obtained by market from the local TGI or Internet World Stats,  
where TGI was not present.  To insure representativity LATAM had an additional weight of 
education applied. The outcome gives us the weighted universe reported in the final database.  
 
After the weighting was run, the efficiency was checked and came to 73.9% which was 
deemed acceptable.  
 
8. Fusion  
 
All respondents completed the core  of which 65%completed part two and 55% went on to 
complete part 3. The respondents who answered all 3 par ts of the survey were used as donors 
for the fusion which was a total of 36,798. Those respondents donated information to the other 
set of respondents who didn’t answer all parts of the survey but had answered the core , the 
number of respondents who were r ecipients was 30,464.  
 
The fusion was a partially unconstrained process, the samples were split by country and 
gender. The fusion used a set of 28 hooks, one of which was age group that was used as a 
critical hook.  For example, a respondent who only comp leted the core would receive data for 
part 2 and 3, whereas a respondent who completed the core and part 2 would only receive 
data for  part 3. After the fusion is run all 67,262 respondents have data for all parts .

9. TGI Global  Quick View classifications  
Several classifications are available as part of the dataset:  
 
1. Life Values  
2. OCEAN  
3. Connected Life  
4. Global Socio Economic Levels  
 
A brief introduction to each can be found below, with more detailed information available upon 
request . 
 
Life Values  
Life Values is a segmentation dividing consumers into groups based on their priorities in life. 
It sheds light on the motivations of brand and category consumers and can show how well 
your brand matches up with the values of its key users. Based on the Schwartz Theory of 
Basic Human Values, Life Values scores respondents across two dimensions and delivers 9 
segments:  
 
• Self-interest and Image vs. Conscience and Spirituality  
• Safety and Conservatism vs. Adventure and Exploration  
 
These s cores are calculated based on respondents’ responses to a series of attitude 
statements.  
 
OCEAN  
OCEAN is a classification that is widely used in the domain of social psychology and, more 
recently, has been used by some of the Media Agency holding -groups fo r their consumer 
profiling and planning. OCEAN produces scores for five personality traits:  
 
1. Openness  
2. Conscientiousness  
3. Extraversion  
4. Agreeableness  
5. Neuroticism  
 
Each trait has a score ranging from -4 to 4. Depending on market distribution, the following 
score ranges indicate high, neutral and low levels of each trait:  
 
 High:   Scores of +4, +3, +2  
 Neutral:  Scores of +1, 0 -1 
 Low:   Scores of -2, -3, -4 
 
Connected Life  
Developed by Kantar Insights, the Connected Life segmentation divides consumers into 
groups based on their digital influence and social engagement. Five connected consumer 
segments with distinct behavioural and attitudinal profiles allow for more granular targeting.  
 
 
8 
 
Global  Socio Economic Levels  
TGI Global SELs have been developed as a “s ocial grading” system which can be used 
across countries. In most countries a national social grading system already exists for 
commercial market research, but these systems differ significantly between countries These 
scores will relate quite closely to e ach national Social Grade but  will provide a uniform and 
comparable method of calculation across all countries.

Appendix  
SIGNIFICANCE AND VALIDITY OF RESULTS  
Table 1  allows the calculation of 95% confidence limits for percentage penetration statistics 
in TGI. To use this table, look up the percentage to be tested in the appropriate column, and 
the unweighted Sample figure in the row. The intersection of the row and co lumn gives the 
confidence limit figure required.  
For example, if a magazine has a sample of 200 readers, and 30% of these have bought a 
Video Game in the last year, Table 1 shows that the 95% confidence limits for this percentage 
are + 7.3%. So, there is o nly a 1 in 20 chance that the true population figure is outside the 
range 22.7% to 37.3% (i.e. 30% - 7.3% to 30% + 7.3%).  
If confidence limits for a 25% penetration are required, an estimate can be taken midway 
between the 20% and 30% columns.  
Table 2  is used to calculate the difference needed between two percentages, if we are to be 
95% certain this observed difference is real. To use this table, first calculate confidence limits 
for each of the two percentages to be tested, using Table 1.  
For example, if Table 1 gives confidence limits of 6% and 4% for the two percentages being 
compared, then Table 2 shows that a 7.2% difference is needed for us to be sure that the 
difference is real.  
So if we are testing penetrations of 25% and 14%, with 6% and 4% confide nce limits, we can 
conclude with 95% certainty that this is a real difference, as the actual difference of 11% (25% 
- 14%) exceeds the required figure of 7.2%. If we are testing 20% against 15%, we cannot 
conclude that this is a real difference which would  be replicated in the population, as the 
difference of 5% is below the required figure of 7.2%.  
Table 3  is used to calculate the confidence limits for an Index, assuming the Index to be tested 
is based against an Index of 100 for an All Adults population.  
Suppose that, as before, we are testing for a magazine with a sample of 200 readers, of whom 
30% of these have bought a Video Game in the last year. Suppose TGI shows this cell to have 
an Index of 130 compared with the adult population.  
Using the 30% colum n, and the 200 row, we obtain a figure of + 24 from Table 3. This tells us 
that we can be 95% certain that the true Index in the Population lies between 106 and 154 
(i.e. between 130 – 24 and 130 + 24). As the figure of 100 is not within this range, we can  be 
virtually certain that the true Index exceeds 100.  
If a difference between two Index figures needs to be tested, use Table 2 to test the difference 
between the corresponding percentages. If the difference between percentages is significant, 
then so is the difference between the Index figures.

Kantar’s Great Britain TGI consumer data provides a uniquely 
comprehensive 360-degree view of the offline and online 
characteristics and behaviour of Britain’s consumers.
For the TGI survey Kantar interview a representative sample of 
over 24,000 adults aged 15+ every year in Great Britain about 
their behaviour and characteristics.
Our industry-recognised data is derived from user-consented 
research generating rich insights into consumer characteristics, 
behaviours and attitudes across an extremely broad range 
of categories.
Representative survey  
of adults in Great Britain
Through our integration with InfoSum, you can now match first-party customer data 
to Kantar’s comprehensive demographic, attitudinal, product use, leisure and media 
consumption data to enrich your customer understanding and fill knowledge gaps.Insight and Enrichment
Your first-party customer data is stored in your own private cloud instance known as 
a Bunker, from there the raw data never moves, and only the Bunker owner, you, 
has access to it. To allow for privacy-first collaboration, anonymous mathematical 
representations of the data are used to (virtually) match data sets for analysis, meaning 
no personal information is ever exposed.How it worksLeverage the insight derived from your TGI-enriched first-party data to identify 
previously hidden activation audiences. This seed audience(s) informs a modelled or 
expanded addressable audience for use within the InfoSum ecosystem or distributed 
to your adtech and martech partner platforms for extended campaign reach. ActivationAbout Kantar’s partnership with InfoSumAbout Kantar’s partnership with InfoSum

partnership with InfoSum. InfoSum’s 
Data Collaboration Platform and ‘non-
movement of data’ approach enables

data with Kantar’s TGI data for analysis, 
segmentation and activation, without 
having to share any data.
The TGI Consumer Data is powered by 
Kantar’s data-collection experts – Kantar 
Profiles – enabling us to bring together 
rich TGI Data profiles with the identity 
keys for over 400,000 panellists in  
our Bunker.
The customers within your Bunker are

InfoSum and Kantar partner to unlock the value of first-party data

The collaboration enables marketers to access enriched audience insight and activation in a privacy-safe way

A new partnership between InfoSum, the world’s leading data collaboration platform, and Kantar, the global evidence-based insights and consulting company, will help advertisers to better understand and engage target audiences by enriching their own first-party data with Kantar’s TGI consumer insights.

By layering Great Britain TGI data onto their own customer records through InfoSum advertisers can build a deeper understanding of their consumers across attitudes, demographics, use of particular goods and services, leisure activities and media consumption. They can also connect consumer segmentations from TGI to their first-party data to create richer bespoke audiences for activation across online and offline advertising channels.

Crucially the new Kantar and InfoSum partnership will allow marketers to build this detailed picture within a secure, privacy-safe framework, complementing their own user-consented data with that from Kantar. 

Sunil Modha, Sales Director at InfoSum, commented: “We are excited to partner with Kantar to give marketers a new privacy-first way to connect Kantar’s rich TGI consumer insight to their own first-party data. Safe and secure data collaboration is more important than ever. The depreciation of third-party cookies has resulted in a loss of connectivity and customer knowledge for many companies. To future-proof their marketing, brands and media owners need to be able to access insights that enable them to deliver better campaigns while protecting consumers’ personal information. That is exactly where our ‘non-movement of data’ approach comes into play.”

Sarah Sanderson, Director – Strategy, Insight & TGI, UK & Ireland, at Kantar’s Media Division, commented: “Smart brands today are developing purposeful data strategies; understanding how they can merge their own data with privacy-compliant data from other sources to develop a meaningful understanding of their customers’ drivers, preferences and attitudes. In partnering with InfoSum we are enabling advertisers to unlock the power of that detailed first-party data by combining it with the breadth and wide-ranging insight we capture through TGI.  Building on TGI’s longstanding expertise and value for advertisers, this partnership means marketers get the critical holistic, in-depth understanding of their consumers they need to inform their strategy right across the marketing cycle – from insight, to planning, to activation – in a highly data privacy compliant framework.”

 1. Introduction  
Kantar has integrated its TGI consumer survey data with audience insights from Route, making the data 
available within the Route dataset.  
The move means clients will be able to identify audiences and buy sophisticated out -of-home advertising i n 
one place. Previously, media planners and buyers who had mapped in -depth out -of-home audiences using 
TGI data had to substitute this for standard demographics when using Route.  
Kantar’s Great Britain TGI survey gives a detailed picture of day -to-day cons umer behaviours, attitudes, and 
media consumption to help marketers create highly targeted campaigns.  Combining TGI’s consumer data 
with Route’s rich out of home insights enables clients, who buy both TGI and Route data, to pinpoint and reach 
audiences mo re effectively, track return on investment and maximise the value of their campaigns.

 2. Explanation of the Fusion Approach  
The 2 datasets used were:  
1. Route R38 dataset , having a sample of 25,447 respondents and covering the period: beginning of 2016 
– end of 2019.  
2. TGI 2021 Q1 dataset , having a sample of 24,192 respondents and covering the period: October 2019 – 
September 2020.  
The plan is to update the fusion each time that Route renews its sample.  
Software:  KFUSION, using a partially constrained approa ch, where each recipient is matched to the closest 
donor found from the donor dataset, based on the distance function implemented; we introduced some 
constraints that prevent over -using some donors and leaving others unused.  
Direction of fusion:  TGI (Donor ) donates information into Route (Recipient).  
Steps for creating the fusion:  
1. Identify the common variables between the two databases and align their answers; these are the potential 
fusion hooks. Between the two datasets 119 common variables with similar meaning and compatible 
answer categories were identified.  
2. Identify dependent variables in the TGI dataset. These are typically the variables we are likely to fuse 
across; in other words, we tested our fusion hooks to see how good they are at ""predicting"" these particular 
variables.  
3. ""Construct"" the dependent variables in the Route data. It is also important that the fusion variables are 
good predictors of the Route behaviour; so, we wanted to test our fusion hooks against them. The most 
difficult part was h ow to summarise the Route behaviour data into a form that could be analysed. For the 
dependent variables we selected Real Behaviour variables only because the Travel Survey data is 
modelled and not relevant for classification of the panellists.  
Travel Surv ey Activity have the following characteristics:  
— Type of Day (Weekday / Weekend)  
— Daypart (0600 -1000 / 1000 -1600 / 1600 -1900 / 1900 -3000)  
— Mode (Vehicular / Pedestrian)  
— Environment (Roadside / Tax / Bus etc etc - 20 possibly but only 14 being used at the mome nt) 
— Town (being the Route Town of the Frame - ie where it was viewed)  
And we can compare the Town (Location) of the Frame with that of the Panellist to end up with:  
— Town - Activity occurring in Panellist's ""Home"" Town  
— Local - Activity occurring in Panellist's Local Authority  
— Area - Activity occurring in Panellist's Defined Area  
— BARB - Activity occurring in Panellist's BARB Region  
— Other - Activity occurring outside Panellist's BARB Region  
We analysed various combinations of these elements by Days Act ive and Number of Activities to quantify the 
behaviour of Route Panellists, and thus been able to measure the ability of fusion hooks to predict this 
behaviour.

 4. Run Fusion Hook Analysis (FHA) in order to identify the hooks and their important weights. For better 
accuracy, we established the Gender and Defined Area as critical hooks and performed FHA within each 
critical. Thus, we identified the hooks which are good at predicting both TGI and Route dependent variables 
within each specific critical segment.  
Geographical area is an important variable in the analysis, and we put a lot of weight on performing accurate 
results.  
The geographical areas were created by defining the country with the following hierarchy:  
> Entire Country  
>> BARB Regions (13) 
>>> Defined Areas (37) 
>>>>  TGI Local Authorities (405)  
>>>>>  Route Town (1642)  
Having some information about the panellists, we could identify the Defined Area. So, for TGI panellists, we 
can identify the Local Authority and thus can deduce the Defined Area a nd BARB Region. Similarly, for Route 
panellists, we can identify the Town and thus can deduce the Local Authority, the Defined Area and BARB 
Region.  
In the analysis, Gender has 2 categories (1=male and 2=female), while Defined Area has 37 categories (pleas e 
see the table below); interlacing the two created a total of 74 critical segments, which means that a Route 
Recipient female from Sheffield will get information from a TGI Donor female from Sheffield only.

After performing FHA, each of the 74 sets received a weight for the 20 most important hooks within that critical 
segment.  
Additionally, we introduced another Fusion Hook (with very high weight / importance) saying that we should 
ideally fuse within Local Authority. So, taking our Route Recipient female from Sheffield - let us assume they 
are in Rotherham Local Authority. As described above, they must be paired with a TGI Donor female in 
Sheffield; but the processing would heavily favour those potential Don ors that were in Rotherham Local 
Authority (the same as the Recipient).  
Finally, we ended up with 74 sets of critical segments; within each critical segment were considered the most 
important 20 hooks resulting from the FHA, plus the additional hook – Loca l Authority (with a very important 
weight, higher than the rest of the other hooks).  
The list of hooks from the table below contains all 74 hooks used in any combination of mini -fusions, given by 
the critical hooks already defined (gender by defined area) . So, for example, on the critical segment 10, which 
is definitory for male respondents from Derby, a set of 20 hooks from the table below was identified, using 
statistical methods, to be representative for this specific group of respondents.

Distribution of Route Recipients and TGI Donors across critical segments  
The distributions of Donors and Recipients across critical segments are well balanced. There are very small 
groups, with 50 panellists each, but also critical segments with a size of over 1,900 respondents. Even though, 
the ratio between Recipients and Don ors within each group is almost 1:1; on average, the ratio is of 1.05 
Recipients per Donors, but the ranges of ratio spread between 0.64 and 1.37.  
In the definition of critical segments, we have numbers with 2 and 3 digits: the first digit is either 1 (ma le) or 2 
(female) and represents the gender; the next one or two digits represents the Defined Area and has values 
from 1 to 37 (their labels are displayed in the “Defined Area categories” table in the appendix).  
For example, the critical segment 15 conta ins only male respondents from East of England; there are 863 
recipients and 842 donors, and their ratio is of 1.025.  
Donors’ usage  
Donors’ usage plays a huge factor in the results we see at the end of a fusion. If donors are being used too 
often, this co uld vastly impact the results we see. This can be tracked using histograms displaying donor usage 
for each critical segment.  
To encourage a sensible Usage of Donors we had a Usage Penalty of 5.000; being the same as the Penalty 
for being a different Loca l Authority. In other words, rather than using one Donor twice and another not at all, 
we would instead use the two Donors once each if the Distance Cost of doing so was not more than 5.000.   

 
 
 
 
© Kantar 202 1 8 
 Most of the TGI Donors (8,276) were 
used only once in the fusion. A 
number of 6,428 Donors donated 
information twice, 1,385 Donors 
donated the information three times, 
while 40 Donors give their information 
4 times to different Recipients. Also, 
8,063 TGI Donors were not used at all 
in the fusion.  
We have put particular emphasis on 
matching on locality, given how the 
fusion is to be used, and this 
inevitability leads to some donors not 
being optimum for use. Additionally, 
because we are trying to use each 
donor approximatively once, there 
would be considerable incompatibility 
between recipients and donors.  
Another reason which explains the unused donors is given by the data itself and the fusion methodology: all 
the missing answers are treated as unknown a nd any recipient tends to choose a donor with valid answers for 
hooks. We have identified a couple of media questions where the routing implies missing answers are, in fact, 
“no”(s). This is a major contributor to the number of unused donors and would be a ddressed in the next release.  
Within each critical segment, each donor was used, usually, for 2 -3 times. The histograms of the donor’s usage 
for each individual critical segment can be find in Appendix . Only for 7 critical segments, some donors were 
used for 4 times; these critical segments are: (1,3), (1,6), (1,7), (1,25), (1,33), (2,6) and (2,7).  
Average Donor Usage per critical segment  
The average Donor Usage for the whole fusion is 1.05, a value very closed to the ideal value of 1.  
Across the critical segments, there are variations of the donors’ usage between 0.64 (in the critical segment 
(1,2), where we have 221 donors and 142 recipients) and 1.37 (in the critical segment (1,33), where we have 
256 donors and 350 recipients).  
For example, the critical segment 110, which represents male respondents from Derby, has an average donor 
usage of 1.11, which means that there are more recipients than donors in that critical segment and one donor 
can donate its information to multiple recipients.  
Full b reakdown provided in the Appendix.  
Bar score  
Distance:  We track the mean distance between recipients and donors over time. We calculate the Actual  
which is the average taken over the fused data, the Random  which is the average taken over all possibilities  
and the Best which is the average taken over all the best possible matches. The BAR score  is: 
With the assumption that Random > Actual > Best.  
Random – the mean distance between all possibilities will obviously give us the largest distance.  
Best – the mean distance between all the BEST possible matches will give us the shortest distance  
Actual – we expect this Actual distance to fall somewhere between the Random and the Best, as we expect 
to be better than matching against all possibilities but not  quite ever reaching the best matching as that ignores

 several factors and solely focuses on being the shortest distance (not factoring in donor usage restrictions/ 
targets and so on).  
In the case of this fusion, the bar score has a value of 94.43 units. Within each critical segment, the bar score 
has values from 84.74 (the lowest) to 96.99 (the highest). The details regarding the bar score values for each 
critical segment can be provided upon request.  
Across all 25,447 recipients, 49.9%  received informat ion from the Donor located at the minimum (best) 
distance, which means a total of 12,698 recipients. The rest of 13,015 recipients received information from 
other donors, which are not located at the shortest distance. This is in line with our expectations  given that we 
only have one recipient for every donor.  
Charts showing the proportion of best donors chosen across all critical segments are shown in the Appendix.

 3. Quality of matches  
When assessing the fusion and its performance, how closely the values match throughout the fusion hooks 
selected is paramount to determining how well a fusion is performing.  
The fusion has perfect matches between Donors and Recipients by Gender and Defined Area, these two being 
critical hooks for the fusion. As long as a Rec ipient Male from Sheffield is always matching with a Donor Male 
from Sheffield, the quality of matches for Gender and Defined Area will always be 100%.  
There are also good matches for Local Authorities, the most important hook of the fusion; in almost hal f of the 
cases (46.61%), Recipients found matches from the same Local Authority. Otherwise, we could not control the 
perfect matches and Recipients were paired with Donors from other Local Authorities; if respondents could not 
match exactly on Local Author ities, it is equally important if matches are 1 or more categories apart).  
An important measure of the performance of the fusion is obtained by checking the matching rate between 
donors and recipients. For the TGI and Route fusion, the exact matching rate  is, on average across all 
critical segments, of 38.01% .  
Where records did not match exactly, the recipient record was mostly matched to a donor record with an 
‘adjacent’ answer. For example, a donor from age category 30 -34 years old may be matched to a r ecipient in 
the next age group: 25 -29 or 35 -39 years old; in this case, 76.98% of respondents donates information to the 
same age category or a neighbour one. Overall, if adjacent matches are included, the average matching rate 
for the whole fusion is 70.7 8%. 
On the other side, if recipients could not match with a donor from the same hook’ category or the closest 
neighbour one, they find matches which are 2 or more categories apart (match ±2 or over); the matching rate 
for 2 or more categories apart is, ove rall, of 29.28% for the fusion. The reason is the large ranges of answers 
of each hook; also, the hooks which registered missing answers were threated separately: the matches 
between a valid answer and a missings/ missing with valid answer/ missing with mi ssing – were considered, 
in terms of quality of matches, as being 2 or more categories apart.  
For categorical hooks, like Local Authority and marital status, we can have perfect match or not a perfect 
match. For example, a perfect match is when a male rec ipient from a Local Authority within Sheffield could 
find a male donor from the same Local Authority from Sheffield. Otherwise, if the perfect match is not possible 
under Local Authority, is equally important is the recipient matches a donor from any of th e Local Authorities 
available from Sheffield.  
 
The chart below  presents the average values for quality of matches across all 74 critical segments. Only the 
critical hooks (Defined Area and Gender) and Local Authority were hooks in all segments, while most of the 
other hooks were part of only some of the segments.  
Being split in critical segments, the fusion basically run for 74 times in order to produce the required outputs.  
Overall, the recipients and donors match perfectly in 38.01% of the cases, while across the critical segments, 
perfect matches were identified within a range of between 33.69% (the minimum) and 52.75% (the maximum).  
In the case of perfect matches or adjacent too, respondents could match someone from their category or an 
‘adjacent’ one, on an average of 72.70% (all categorical hooks which did not match perfectly were considered 
having a difference of ±1 and were includ ed in the ‘adjacent1 category); the rest of 27.29% of respondents 
were matched with donors whose answers were 2 or more categories apart.  
For example, in the critical segment 131, which contains information regarding the male respondents from 
Swansea, the  perfect matches between donors and recipient are of 52.09%; also, if the recipients got 
information from donors whose answers were exactly the same or 1 category apart, the matching percentage 
increases to 88.64%. Regarding the critical hook 232 (female r espondents from Bristol and Bath), recipients 
got exactly the same information from donors on a proportion of 37.21%, and while the donated information 
came from the same or adjacent category, the proportion of matches increases to 70.55%.

 4. Checks Perfo rmed on the Fused Dataset  
The fused data was checked within Route and mostly made sense.  There were a few areas highlighted that 
we investigated further and whilst a satisfactory explanation can be found, we will look to control for these in 
future iterat ions of the fusion.  
Working Status  
In the fused dataset, the proportion of ‘working full time’ is consistently higher than seen in the TGI data 
(typically 5 -6% points higher). This looks to be a function of the samples and the fact that working status is n ot 
a controlled variable within TGI.  
Market sizing (horizontal %s)  
These are quite often higher in the fused dataset than we see in the TGI data. There are some instances of it 
going the other way, but not many.  If we take the monthly listeners to Capital  Network as an example, Route 
has this at 15.5% incidence whereas TGI has it at 12.2% and RAJAR at 12.01%. Whilst this is fairly close, it 
could add significantly to the audience figures for a station.  
It is worth highlighting that this fusion (and indeed TGI itself) is intended to be used to understand audiences  
rather than as a market sizing tool.  
There are two reasons for the increase in market sizing:  
1. We are currently classifying all TGI respondents who have not answered questions (eg ""Do you listen to 
Radio on Weekdays"") as ""Unknown"". But in many cases, they were not asked the question due to a 
previous filter - such respondents should be classified as ""No"". The fusion is reluctant to use Donors with 
""Unknown"" values for Hooks; thus we tend not to use a  significant block of Donors that don't listen to Radio 
at all. This will be addressed in future iterations of the fusion.  
2. The Route sample has a higher incidence of Respondents claiming to use radio (eg ""Listen to Radio on 
Weekdays"") than TGI. So, when we  use this Radio Listen question as a Hook; we tend to use as Donors 
the TGI Radio Listeners a bit more than those who do not, to match the Route distribution.  
Both of the above describe why the TGI Donors who listen to Radio are more likely to be used than  those who 
do not. Clearly, if that is the case, then we will also see higher numbers of ""listeners"" to individual stations in 
the fused Route data than in the original TGI data.

 Proportion of Best Donors Chosen  
The first chart contains the information for 37 critical segments where gender is male (first digit of critical 
segments starts with 1), while the second one contains information about the other 37 critical segments on 
which the gender is given by females (first digit of critical segments starts with 2).  
For example, on critical segment 126, which represents male respondents from Portsmouth, 68.04% of 
recipients chosen the best donor for them, while, on the other side, on critical segment 17 (male responde nts 
from Outer London), only 42.23% of recipients got data from the donor located at the best distance, which is 
also good.  
 
 
For the critical segments where gender is given by females, the highest percent of recipients who got 
information from their best donors is registered by the critical segment 21 (female respondents from Border, 
61.96%), while on the other extreme is critic al segment 210 (female respondents from Derby), for which 
36.36% of recipients got information from the donors located at the smallest distance.

In-depth understanding of out-of-home audiences for enhanced targeting
Presenter name(s) here
Project reference here
Date here

In a fast-changing media landscape, out-of-home media owners need more than ever to be able to prove the value of their audiences as compellingly as possible to advertisers…
…whilst media agencies are under increasing pressure to maximise the value of their out-of-home advertising campaigns and integrate these effectively within the cross-media mix.
2
Define and target more valuable audiences…

The Route-TGI fusion enables the building of sophisticated out-of-home audiences that optimise their value, directly within the buying platform.
No longer need an in-depth outdoor audience developed with TGI data be reduced to blunt, standard demographics for buying purposes.
Out-of-home audiences can be understood and bought directly according to their consumer characteristics and behaviour as a whole, including product usage, media habits, leisure activities, attitudes and more. 
3
Benefits…
Analyse out-of-home audiences beyond demographics (attitudes, product use, media consumption etc) for targeting optimisation.
Identify more subtle and relevant targets and reduce budget wastage.
Maximise sales revenue from out-of-home sites by uncovering new brand efficiencies.
Leverage TGI consumer data’s utility right across the planning process to target consistently-defined audiences at every stage of planning, for more joined-up cross media campaigns.

The breadth and depth of TGI Consumer Data vastly enriches out-of-home audience understanding 
Data you can trust
How we do it



TGI Consumer Data
Provides in-depth insight into consumer characteristics and behaviour: product use, attitudes, media consumption, leisure activities
The Route-TGI fusion is a nationally representative survey of adults (aged 15+) in Great Britain.
Route
The UK buying and selling data currency for out-of-home audience measurement. Provides topline demographics of people who have seen out-of-home advertising campaigns
It is created by fusing our in-depth TGI consumer data on to Route – the out-of-home audience buying and selling data currency in the UK.

GWI has several component solutions within 
their portfolio

information on consumer trendsPitch:
4
Overview of GWI SWOT
•Consistent international data for 
cross -country comparison
•Proposal heavily focussed on 
servicing ‘light’ data users
•Established brand profile with digital 
media clients (social, VOD)•“One hit wonder”: Fulfils a particular 
niche on international data but no 
broader portfolio of solutions
•Data quality credentials doubted by 
many in market versus currencies (TGI)
•Lack of local service/support outside 
UK/US
•Demand for lighter and easy -to-
access solutions from advertisers
•Continued fragmentation in global 
data from established planning 
providers (YouGov; Kantar; Nielsen)
•Harmonisation of regional and 
global insight activities within 
Agency Hold Cos•Need to develop local credentials to 
entrench their services (hence: move 
into US Local space)
•Few owned assets. Dependence on 
third-party panel providers. No 
significant tech IP (e.g. no metering)
•Competitive analysis suggests clients 
would prefer single vendor and not GWI 
+ Kantar buy.GWIs Strengths: GWI’s Weaknesses:
GWI Opportunities: GWI’s Threats:Two points to pay particular attention to:
Not under -representing the importance of 
simplified global insights >
We should acknowledge the importance –
but stress that global data is only part of a 
complete insight package (which might 
include consultancy or deep -dive local 
data).
GWI’s share -of-voice and positioning on 
insight -reports >
GWI produce a lot of content (quick 
insights; Chart of the Week) but we want 
to discriminate between volume and 
quality of content. A lot of GWI insight is 
superficial and doesn’t offer enough for 
an advertiser to tell a differentiated story 
for their brand.
5
GWI is a well -developed ‘niche service’ but, 
as Kantar, we now have a newly -instituted 
global TGI Data layer (in GQV) that can fulfil 
the same use -case/need within your 
business
Unlike GWI, TGI is a portfolio product –with 
in-depth local services where you require 
them. There are incremental efficiencies in 
using Kantar for both a global and local 
view.TGI’s extra level of depth allows for 
customisation that will benefit your brand. 
We can give you different tools and 
different levels of access for each type of 
user in your businessOverview of ‘killer messages’ to the market
GWI creates a lot of generic insights –but 
we think brands require Kantar’s additional 
level of customised service and 
consultancy (from rich data -sets and local 
experts) to tell truly differentiating stories.GWI is a uniformly applied, light -touch 
online methodology that can lead to lower 
quality of outcomes for particular markets 
and regions. Only Kantar has on -the-ground 
understanding of markets to deliver the 
most trusted methods.

•Strong relationships with advertisers

•Service highly optimised around

•Offers are more frequently bundled

•Product portfolio is weak on media 
assets (no TAM; no CMP type services)
•Products are platform -focussed. Few/no 
consultancy or local support services
•Increasing price sensitivity of clients 
presents an opp to YG
•Market shift towards consolidation 
of services (in Agencies)
•Demand for lighter and more 
customisable planning solutions 
from advertisers•Lack of endorsement from media 
owners undermines utility of 
planning service
•Individual Kantar components 
stronger than YG ‘look -a-like’ offers 
•In non -European markets, lack of 
local knowledge and localised 
methodologyYouGov’s Strengths: YouGov’s Weaknesses:
YouGov’s Opportunities: YouGov’s Threats:We need to be wary of two things:
YouGov would like to frame the argument 
as ‘modern versus old -fashioned’ >
We should frame the argument around 
<novelty versus utility>
YouGov address the CPO and CFO of a 
prospect >
We need to ensure that our arguments 
reach both as well as the Insights Leads
5
Our methodology is more useful and more 
trustworthy. YouGov doesn’t allow for 
accurate audience sizing and doesn’t 
truly represent the total population
Media -owners internationally have not 
endorsed YouGov. The world’s leading 
broadcasters and publishers use TGI 
Data
YouGov do not have the research 
experts of Kantar . YouGov don’t have the 
analytics experts and media experts to help 
you extract real value from data. Across 
Kantar, we have the scale and expertise to 
meet any requirement you haveOverview of ‘killer messages’ to the market
Only Kantar has world -leading dedicated 
media solutions like CMAM and CMP . 
Currency grade solutions only come with 
Kantar.
YouGov do not have the local expertise 
of Kantar . YouGov’s data isn’t backed -up 
with the market experts who understand 
Brazil and its specific requirements. YouGov 
is a ‘one size fits all’ platform only

As new ways are sought to understand and enrich audiences to target consumers efficiently online in world of much diminished reliance on third party cookies, of the new ID-free solutions, geo data is proving increasingly important.

Key geo-targeting needs:

Introducing TGI Geo Affinities
Our solution:
TGI Geo Affinities enables you to understand at-a-glance the affinity of any TGI audience against every postcode (to district and sector-level) in Great Britain, for more efficient targeting and media sales.

Visualise and explore complex audiences by and within small geographical areas
Identify key targets, brands and product categories for fine-grained geo-based plans
Leverage TGI Geo Affinities for digital activation and audience sales (CTV, DOOH or Display) at the local level against any TGI-defined target

TGI Geo Affinities: Methodology

3. Cloud-based engine applies statistical (SPDE)            process per audience
1. Original TGI audience by demographic and by postcode
2. NSO Census demographics and geographic data by postcode district

4. Generation of outputs controlled to demographics within postcode sector
TGI Geo Affinities: High-level methodology
Unlike other solutions, TGI Geo Affinities isn’t about giving you postcode data against existing sample, but about providing a robust estimation of audience characteristics within each and every GB postcode sector. Built in collaboration with geo-statistics experts ShoWhere, TGI Geo Affinities is built on robust modelling processes and a cloud-architecture that enables fast generation of predictions for any TGI audience.

TGI Geo Affinities: User journey
Define the TGI audiences you wish to understand at the local level

These audiences are geo-modelled by Kantar Media TGI, leveraging our partner modelling engine
Geo-modelled audiences returned, revealing postcode sectors with greatest affinity against your audiences
Leverage outputs through your own platform, or via ShoWhere visualisation software (see next slide)




A custom audience (e.g. for a particular advertiser) can be generated in 1-3 days and delivered to your account.

Alternatively, we can pre-build a larger range of relevant, thematic audiences that you require for ongoing use.

There also exists a pre-built taxonomy comprising circa 100 high value TGI audiences ready for geo-targeting (see Appendix for more).

TGI Geo Affinities outputs can be data-only (flat files by postcode district or sector) or dashboard and data (interactive platform and configurable outputs) dependent on your user requirements.

In this example we can see in the ShoWhere dashboard two groups of shoppers, both careful with how they spend their money, but concentrated in very different areas of the country, requiring different targeting. 

6
TGI Geo Affinities in action: Power of sector-level postcode analysis
Agree: “When I see a new brand I often buy it to see what it’s like”

Exploring audience affinities by geographic area at postcode sector level (e.g. for postcode UB7 0EB UB7 is the postcode district and UB7 0 is the postcode sector), makes campaigns exceptionally highly targeted.

The above example shows affinity for agreement with the attitude statement “When I see a new brand I often buy it to see what it’s like” in Newcastle and surrounding areas. This shows a sharp contrast between the immediate Newcastle – where affinity is high (in red) – and nearby areas to the south and west of Newcastle (in blue), where affinity is considerably lower.

Let’s look at some live examples…

TGI Geo Affinities: Selection and configuration options 
Pre-built & custom audiences

We maintain a library of circa 100 pre-built popular audiences that can be accessed for ‘always-on’ use within a 12-month licence period.

Additionally, custom audiences (per campaign) can be created on-demand and delivered to your account on a ‘per-audience’ fee basis.


Data-only or data and dashboard

Analysing segments via the ShoWhere dashboard is a compelling interface for audience management and exporting for any/all users.

However, we also have options to deliver data-files direct to your chosen end-points (e.g. A3 bucket) and can offer this file-only approach.

At TGI we have identified and labeled key audiences in a way that your activation colleagues who use consumer audience taxonomies daily - such as that created by the IAB - will find familiar and meaningful.

This enables you to identify which audiences for digital activation have the greatest affinity with any specific consumer target you create in TGI.

Introduction to Correspondence Analysis

Correspondence Analysis is a market segmentation tool which graphically represents the relationships between brands or products, and other variables such as attitudinal statements, media titles and demographic data.

Through correspondence mapping users can measure the relationships between attitudinal statements, the correlation between brands and also how different brands relate to the statements selected for the analysis.

It can be used either as a preliminary step to running Cluster Analysis through determining the most discriminatory statements for a selected market or as a standalone segmentary relationship function.

Correspondence Analysis runs from the crosstab. Brands or products are placed in columns and attitudinal statements (or other variables) are in Rows.

4
Setting up the crosstab
From the TGI Consumer Analysis home page, click on the Choices Online tile and follow the usual steps to arrive at the Crosstab creation page. 

To access the Correspondence map, add:

To Base - Target market (sample size must be at least 2000) 
To Columns - Targets (usually brands or media vehicles from the target market) – minimum 3 with sample sizes of at least 200
To Rows – A selection of lifestyle statements (You may select ""Any Agree"" to increase your simple sizes or pick ""Definitely agree"" to get a sharper profile of your market)

PLEASE NOTE: If you plan to use to launch Cluster from the Correspondence map, you will need to select ""Any Agree"" by OR'ing Definitely and Tend to Agree. This may be available as a profile list. Please check with your support team.



Once the elements are added to crosstab, the Correspondence icon will become available. Clicking on it will launch the Remote application and open the Correspondence map.

Note: You may want to save your crosstab before you launch Correspondence to come back to it at a later stage.

5
Launch Correspondence
When you launch Correspondence, you will be asked to provide a name for your correspondence analysis. 
6
Launching CorrespondenceThe Correspondence map 
The scenario used for this user guide shows food statements against various chocolate brands, with the target audience set as heavy chocolate consumers. 
7
Initially the Correspondence Map will contain all the lifestyle statements selected in the analysis and needs to be “cleaned-up” to demonstrate the most relevant statements which best describe the market.

The statements can be “cleaned-up” either manually or automatically. To clean-up map manually, click on General Statistics then select Rows. Click on ‘Dist’ to sort statements by distance from Chi-squared (centre of map). Variables at the centre of the map are less differential than those at the edges.

Manual Clean-up Map
Mass % represents the percentage of data contained in the Rows based on the weighted (000) figures.

Dist(ance) ranks the Chi-distance of the data contained in the Rows based on the vertical (Vert) percentage from the origin. The higher the value, the more distinctive the attribute.

Inertia determines how strongly each variable contributes to the shape of the map multiplying the Mass % by Dist.
To select say Top 15 statements; click on         icon to left of statement, right click Select top n…., change to 15, right click and select Invert selection, right click and Change status  passive
8
There are two ways to automatically clean-up a Correspondence Map


Click on                    icon and select the number of variables (usually between 15 – 35).




















Once the number of variables is “Set as default”, click on                      icon and the map will automatically select the top number of variables selected 



Automatic Clean-up Map
9
The Correspondence Analysis produces a map based on the correlations within the data based on the two strongest themes. 
The most influential theme produces the X axis, the second the Y axis. 




















The Total Variance figure shows how well the map explains the variables within it. The figure should be at least 60% of the total market (Horizontal + Vertical axes)

Each statement has a Quality value which is shown by placing the mouse over the chosen variable. The higher the quality, the greater the influence the variable has on the map.

The brands around the centre of the map tend to be more mass market and less differentiated compared to those near the edge which are more niche and differentiated. Those around the edges are usually the smaller, more distinctive brands.

Interpreting Correspondence Map
10
Relationships between brands and with lifestyle statements are illustrated in the Column vs. Column and Column vs. Row Analysis views. The brands/lifestyle statements in red have a close positive correlation to the brand, white has no correlation whereas blue brand/lifestyle statements have a strong negative correlation. 
To scroll between brands use the next target  buttons at the top right: 

Correspondence Analysis
11
To label axes or quadrants click on “Add Label” icon. Label will appear at centre of map.

Double click or select variable(s) and click on “Properties” icon. Enter Font, Label and Label Text  as required.

To alter the map symbols (e.g. to distinguish between columns or rows), right click (or select) symbol, select “Properties”  then                tab.

To “Copy”, “Delete” or “Hide points” select variable(s) and click on required function.

To export the map as a picture for use in other applications, click on           icon.

The project summary report provides an overall summary of the market on which the cluster analysis is based. It lists all the variables included in the analysis detailing the target, mean score and standard deviation.

Project Summary

The sample and weighted figures of the overall population of the base are available in the Project Summary (2000 is minimum sample size).


Mean Score shows the average (mean) score based on allocating 5 points for Definitely Agree to 1 point for Definitely Disagree for each variable in the target market. It is important to be aware of this figure for each variable as this is carried through to the cluster groups where the statements are allocated based on their deviation from this mean score


Standard Deviation indicates the measure (difference) of spread for the answers for each variable. In cases where different scales of answers are used, all variables are normalised to 1 before the analysis is run ensuring each statement has equal importance


20
Cluster Groups can be renamed by clicking on the                    icon from the Toolbar. 



To rename, choose the solution, then click on the Group you want to rename and write your desired new name. Click OK to save the changes. 

Group Names 
21
Analysis Summary
Analysis Summary Statistics provides the Variance Explained % of each of the group solutions. The sample size of each group within the solutions are shown with the group with the highest sample shown in Red and smallest in Blue.

The Variance Explained can be used to filter the solutions that can be used for the analysis. We recommend to use solutions which show a variance explained of at least 15%. 
Solutions which have one group with a sample size significantly smaller or larger than the others may also indicate that the market is not best explained.
















Analysis Summary Charts shows the same information as the Statistics view but in pie chart form with the Variance Explained for each solution shown in brackets. 


Analysis Summary Logs is a simple text report showing the output generated by running the cluster analysis.

22
Cluster Solutions Summary shows a summary of the groups within each solution with the top 3 positive statements in Red and bottom 3 negative statements in Blue. 

If groups have no Red or Blue statements that group is either entirely positive or negative (i.e., Group 1 and Group 2).

This information can be used at the preliminary stage to give an indication of the nature of the group. If all the groups show clear distinctive characteristics, then it is likely that group solution best illustrates the market.
Cluster Solutions: Summary
23
Cluster Solutions Statistics looks at the individual statements comprising each group within the solution based on Standard Deviation from Mean, Absolute Deviation from Mean or Mean. Positive or negative variations in the group are scaled coloured from dark Red to dark Blue


Standard Deviation is the recommended statistic to analyse the groups as the numbers given are the biases for the cluster group (compared to the overall Base sample) which are standardised into units of standard deviations. Therefore, a positive or negative figure is the deviation from the mean of the total sample found in the Project Summary .


In this example we can see the Statistics for Group 1 of Solution 5. 
Cluster Solutions: Statistics
24
To analyse all solutions in one view, click on Toggle button. Within the view it is possible to alternate using the drop-down menu between Standard Deviation from the Mean, Absolute Deviation from the Mean and Mean to build a summary description of each solution.

Cluster Solutions Charts demonstrates in graphical form the individual variables comprising each group. Drop down menus enable toggling between solutions, deviations and, sorting by ascending or descending order.

This view can be used to identify statements that generate a low deviation from the mean for all groups, and therefore have a poor explanation power on all groups. Such statements can be potentially removed from the variable selection before the Cluster is run again, to obtain a sharper and more meaningful analysis.

Cluster Solutions: Statistics

25
Look at each group in detail examining any trends based on the statements. Extra insight can be gained by taking the groups back into Choices to run against demographic and other variables. Groups should not be named based on age, sex or Social class.
Examine whether adding more groups (i.e., from 4 to 5 group solution) adds to the insight or loses focus, and vice versa taking away a group.
Ensure that groups have sample sizes that are representative for further Choices analysis (recommend over 200) and have a variance explained of at least 15%

Correspondence
How can I modify the specification of my Correspondence analysis once the results are produced?
If you wish to modify either the target audience, the brands or the statements used to run your Correspondence map, the only solution is to go back to your Crosstab in Choices Online and make any necessary changes, then launch Correspondence again. Please note that this will create a separate Correspondence document that will be available to you in the Navigator page. 

What happens if I run multiple analysis of Correspondence?
Running multiple analysis of Correspondence starting from the same Crosstab will launch separate instances of the Remote Application and will save different documents of the ‘Correspondence’ file type.

How can I make sure my preferences are saved?
Any changes made to the view of the Correspondence map (background colour, label) can be saved by closing the Choices window within the Remote Application tab. Background colour changes will be available on every report starting from the next launch of Correspondence. 


Can I export my Correspondence map?
You can download a Correspondence map as a Metafile, which can then be used in a Power Point presentation. 

Cluster 
Can I open an analysis from within a Cluster project?
If you do not close the Cluster definition module after running the Cluster analysis, you can continue working on a previously saved Cluster project by selecting ‘Existing Project’ from the Cluster Definition Module window. The Cluster definition module is minimized and available from the bar at the bottom of the remote application screen.

How can I modify the specification of my Cluster analysis once the results are produced?
You can go back to the Cluster Definition Module and either add or remove statements, then run the Cluster process. 

What happens if I run multiple Cluster Analysis?
You can run multiple Cluster Analysis in the same project, but the latest analysis will always replace the previous ones. 

Importing Cluster solution
Can I import my Cluster solution to the dictionary?
Cluster Groups within a solution can be imported to the dictionary from the ‘Import’ button available in the ribbon within the Crosstab in Choices Online. 

Can I delete imported Cluster solutions? 
Cluster solutions that have been imported to the dictionary cannot be deleted. 

Can I create User-defined Cluster variables? 
User-defined cluster variables are not available. Only pre-defined statements can be added to the cluster analysis. 


Sharing
Can I share my Cluster analysis with another user?
You can share the Cluster file available in the Navigator screen and the user will be able to open it in the Cluster Module within the Remote Application. Alternatively, you can import your Cluster solution to the dictionary selecting ‘Common’, and this will make it available to all users within the same company. 
Can I share my Correspondence analysis to another user?
A Correspondence analysis can be shared as a file from the Navigator screen. The user who receives the shared file will be able to open it in the Correspondence module within the Remote Application. 

Saving options in Cluster & Correspondence

Saving Crosstab

Once you have finished building your crosstab by adding your target market in base, your brands in columns and statements in rows, it is recommended that you first save your crosstab so that you will be able to retrieve your specifications. 

Click on the ‘Save’ button on the right-hand side of the tool ribbon and give a name to you report. 



You can access your report from the Navigator screen. 



Saving Correspondence file from Crosstab launch 
After saving your crosstab, click on the Correspondence icon. A dialog invites you to name your Correspondence analysis. 

This file can be accessed from the Navigator and will be shown as a ‘Correspondence’ type. When opened from Navigator, it will lead straight to the Correspondence module within the Remote Application. 



Saving Correspondence file including a Cluster Analysis
Once you have created and launched a Correspondence file, you can create a Cluster Analysis starting from the Correspondence map by selecting the active rows and clicking on ‘Perform Cluster’. 
Create a new Cluster Project by selecting ‘New Project’ from the Cluster Definition Module, then give a name to your project. Alternatively, you can add your new Cluster analysis to an existing project.


Please note that before exiting the Cluster Module in the Remote Application, you must save your Cluster Project from the        icon if you want to be able to access your Cluster project at a later stage and retrieve the variables that you have added. 
Saved Cluster Projects can then be retrieved from the Project folder of the Cluster Application.
Once you run your Cluster Analysis process, your initial Correspondence project (saved at point 1.) will now include the results of the Cluster analysis. Your original file will keep the same name, but the file type will be modified as ‘Correspondence          ‘

When opened from Navigator, it will lead straight to the Correspondence and Cluster results within the Remote Application.
Saving a standalone Cluster file 
When launching a Cluster analysis directly from the crosstab with only a target market (base) selected, you are first prompted to save your Cluster Base before launching the Cluster module within the Remote Application. 


The file that you are saving now is visible in the Navigator as a Cross Tab file type and includes only the Base that you have selected for your Cluster Analysis. 

Once the Cluster Module is launched, you will need to select whether you want to add your analysis to an existing Cluster Project or create a new one.
After adding statements to the variable list within the Cluster Definition window, save the Project from the  icon (as shown at point 3.), then running the Cluster process, you will need to give a name to your Cluster Results file.

The Cluster file saved under this given name is now available in the Navigator as a ‘Cluster Results’ type file and when opened, it will lead straight to the Cluster results within the Remote Application.




All types of files can be shared among users of your company or of a sister company.

Summary











Released features 



Correspondence Analysis Online
When granted from the appropriate module permission in ACCS, Choices Online users can now run a Correspondence analysis from an active Crosstab:









The Correspondence analysis opens in a Remote Desktop application. All features that are present in the Desktop version of Correspondence analysis are available in this online version.

Cluster Analysis Online

1. Running Cluster from a Correspondence Analysis 

Mirroring the Desktop feature, Cluster Analysis can be launched from the Correspondence map, on a selection of lifestyle statements. 





 




The variables selected on the map are automatically selected for the Cluster Analysis



Once the Cluster process is run, the result of the Cluster analysis is available under the correspondence map. 












2. Running Cluster as a standalone

Cluster can also be launched as a Standalone application.

The Cluster module is available from the Choices Online Crosstab page and launches on the selected Base. NB: If no base is selected, Cluster will consider the Total Population as the base of the analysis.


Once the Base and the Project are provided with a name, the user must select the Cluster variables from the Predefined Variables tab.



















 

Once the Cluster process is performed, the Cluster result opens in a new document of the Remote application and can be saved for future use.
Saving, Importing and Sharing

Correspondence and Cluster saved files are stored in TGI Consumer Analysis Navigator:

Clicking on these files will lead the user straight to the Correspondence or Cluster results within the Remote Application.

The import of a Cluster Solution is performed from the Choices Online Crosstab page. 





The file can be either imported at a user level or shared with other users of the same company.
The imported solution is integrated into a new ""CLUSTER"" top level of the dictionary.



Cluster Results and Correspondence map files can be easily shared with other users using the Sharing feature of the Navigator.

About the TGI Green Values segmentation
STEADFAST SKEPTICS
   Actively do not care for the environment and 
will never compromise on lifestyle.
   Do not care about recycling, company ethics, animal testing, pollution.
   Would only start acting green if it saved  
them money.BLASÉ CONSUMERISTS
   Never recycle, do not care for nature and would rather enjoy themselves over anything else. 
   Actively do not want or care to be informed and do not care about ethics.ACCIDENTAL GREENS
   Claim to not be prepared to make lifestyle changes, yet inadvertently live in a way that already makes them green. 
   Likely unaware that these are lifestyle “sacrifices”.  
They are more likely to be late-stage workers or retirees.
   They seem to like to keep with the trend, likely the factor in their inadvertent green values. Practical, comfort over style. PREOCCUPIED PRETENDERS
   Spread quite evenly across demographics. Likely to do green things but only if it suits their lifestyle, i.e. they think there should be more care towards the environment and that people should not only be green to save money, but take no steps to reduce energy and care only a little about animal testing or ethical businesses. 
   Very judgemental by nature, they spend a lot of time preoccupied with their smartphone and online.ECO-AMBASSADORS
   Strongly committed to the environmental cause in both thought and deed. 
   Particularly likely to buy green, be intellectually engaged with environmental issues, recycle and avoid waste.IMPRESSIONABLE MATERIALISTS
   They believe it is only worth doing green things if they save you money and would only do environmentally friendly things if others did  
the same. 
   Could potentially be persuaded to be greener  
if prompted by celebrities/advertising.

All consumers are influenced by the times in which they are born and grow up, with certain broad behaviours and 
values acquired and carried throughout life. By understanding which generation represents the most appropriate target for a brand, campaigns can be made more efficient.

About the TGI Greenscape Clusters
KEEN
Strongly committed to the environmental cause 
in both thought and deed. Particularly likely to buy green, be intellectually engaged with environmental issues, recycle and avoid waste.RESIGNED
Very little engagement with environmental issues and not very well informed about them. Nevertheless, they are particularly likely to buy green and avoid waste, possibly because other people do.
INCIDENTAL
Unlikely to be environmentally friendly through choice, as little engagement with the cause.  
However, how they live their lives means in some ways they are inadvertently environmentally friendly.CAREFREE
Not engaged with environmental issues, more focused on their own lives. Unlikely to recycle compared to the average adult, or to make an effort to minimise waste.PIC’N’MIX
Some engagement with the environment but only where it suits them, e.g. far more likely to consume relatively large amounts of energy through travel.SCEPTIC
Educated individuals, well informed of environmental challenges. However, tend not to identify personally with the need to be environmentally friendly and  
less likely to buy green.

TGI’s Media Neutral Quintiles (MNQs) split consumers of each medium into five equal-sized groups 
based on their level of consumption of that medium. The resulting groups range from the top  
20% (heaviest consumers) to the bottom 20% (lightest consumers). Those who do not consume  
the medium at all are consigned to a separate group of non-consumers. 
MNQs represent an easy-to-use and comparable set of media measurements which have a number of 
uses, from improving campaign efficiency by pinpointing the best media mix, to building a compelling sales argument for a specific medium over others.

Inspired by the work of celebrated French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, who championed the  
understanding of human behaviour through the twin subconscious drivers of economic and cultural 
‘capital’, our segmentation comprises nine separate groups, encompassing every combination  
(low, medium, high) of these two key drivers.
ABOUT THE SEGMENTS
To identify cultural capital, we draw from  
TGI metrics in the following areas:
   Level of education
   Position/job type
   Cultural activities undertaken
   Level of education of parents
   Position/job type of parentsTo identify economic capital, we draw from  
TGI metrics in the following areas:
   Income
  Home ownership/value of home
  Savings
  Ownership of high-value goods

About TGI Word of Mouth
TGI Word of Mouth groups consumers by their claimed expertise, communication reach and 
influence on a particular product or subject. It comprises three strands: 
  How many people consumers talk to about a specific product or interest area 
  How much information they can provide others about it 
  How likely they feel they are able to convince others with their views on it 
Each of these strands relates to a list of products/services and areas of interest that are likely to be discussed with friends and family on a day-to-day basis.
KEY CATEGORIES COVERED BY WORD OF MOUTH
Products and Services  
Household products, alcoholic drinks, toiletries and cosmetics, financial services, cars, TV/audio visual equipment, mobile phones, computers and computer software, home appliances, clothes and accessories. 
Areas of Interest   
Music, sport, films, computer and console gaming, public affairs/politics, jobs and 
careers, the arts, holidays and travel, food and dining, healthy living, DIY/gardening.
WORD OF MOUTH SEGMENTS
Consumers are subsequently segmented according to the kind of Word of Mouth strengths they have in each market. These segments are: 
   Connectors:   
those who promote messages  
to the widest audience 
   Mavens:   
those who carry influence  
through their knowledge 
   Salespeople:   
those who carry the power  
of persuasion  Understand how personal recommendations can complement the impact of mass media messages

UK technology provider case study Helping the brand better understand, resonate with and activate key segments

CHALLENGE

Our client wants to be at the forefront of the next big technological disruption in their industry, but activating this in a way that is motivating and speaks to core business objectives is a challenge. 
They needed a deeper understanding of key acquisition and retention segments, to understand their needs and how to engage with them in a meaningful way.


APPROACH

We blended data from across the Kantar network:
Worldpanel ComTech consumer behaviour data to define the segments.
Campaign Optimiser Tracking to explain consumers view of the client and the competition.
TGI advanced profiling to describe consumers contextually, and inform where the client should put media.


INSIGHT

5 key retention and acquisition segments were defined based on brands usage, and awareness and willingness to purchase the new technology. 
For each segment we were able to size the opportunity, and identify nuanced differentiation in interests and media behaviours.
We were also able to outline for the client the key brand strengths and weaknesses of each segment.
IMPACT

Increased research ROI by:
Enabling an understanding of key segments at different stages of consumer adoption. 
Helping the brand build activation to disrupt in the most meaningful way.
Development of a playbook to activate against in the future, helping the client’s marketing and creative teams.

Tate & Lyle, a global provider of food and beverage solutions, wanted to own ‘breakfast moments’ by making its golden syrup the go-to breakfast topping.
Its campaign focused on how “ridiculously simple and wonderfully tasty” porridge can be by adding Lyle’s Golden Syrup.
Its media agency, m/Six, wanted to engage consumers through Facebook who were already buying porridge.
The challenge
2.9x above average for sales uplift
3.9x above average for ad recall
1.9x above average for unaided brand awareness
4.0x above average for consideration
The campaign performance was measured against brand and sales uplift. It achieved significantly above all FMCG benchmarks*:
The approach
We identified several key targets based on our purchase panel: heavy & medium porridge buyers, porridge sachets buyers, heavy & medium traditional porridge buyers.
These targets were matched, extended and onboarded into Facebook through LiveRamp, allowing m/Six to address the campaign based on these segments.
Using actual purchase data for media targeting to generate brand and sales lifts

Online betting company Betway Group needed to drive new user traffic to its website during the Cheltenham Festival, one of the biggest annual horse racing events in the UK – but their existing segments, based solely on online behaviours, were not sufficient to get a full picture of their potential audience.
The challenge
6x increase in website visits by new users
88% reduction in cost per acquisition
The campaign performance was measured against new users generated by the campaign.
The approach
Betway and their agency used TGI data to build segments based on both online and offline behaviours, enabling them to identify gamblers no matter how they placed their bets.
The target segments were then matched and modelled with programmatic partners to activate via media-buying platform the TradeDesk, driving a huge increase in traffic around the event.

Global Product Marketing – internal use only
Describe the proposition
TGI Target Export enables clients to access TGI Consumer Data at scale. So they can profile their audiences and activate their targets in the programmatic platforms of their choice to improve targeting and campaign effectiveness.
Users define audience profiles using TGI Audience Activation survey via the TGI Target Export application.
The defined audience profiles are sent directly from the TGI Target Export application to Kantar's Profiles Panel Network, which uses serial numbers to look up at scale respondent level data and match them to IDs of a given programmatic platform. Kantar Profiles then send the information to the 3rd party or client platform to upload the data for the modelling and activation of audience targets.

Reason to believe
The TGI Target Export application provides functionality to connect planning and execute targeting segments in a faster and simple way for our clients.
It supports clients in activating digital campaigns to better reach the right audiences and make their ad campaigns more productive by building target audiences with TGI Consumer Data and connecting them to any programmatic platforms.

​The new app allows for TGI Consumer Data to be connected to clients and 3rd party platforms and activate faster targets. ​

InfoSum and Kantar partner to unlock the value of first-party data

The collaboration enables marketers to access enriched audience insight and activation in a privacy-safe way

A new partnership between InfoSum, the world’s leading data collaboration platform, and Kantar, the global evidence-based insights and consulting company, will help advertisers to better understand and engage target audiences by enriching their own first-party data with Kantar’s TGI consumer insights.

By layering Great Britain TGI data onto their own customer records through InfoSum advertisers can build a deeper understanding of their consumers across attitudes, demographics, use of particular goods and services, leisure activities and media consumption. They can also connect consumer segmentations from TGI to their first-party data to create richer bespoke audiences for activation across online and offline advertising channels.

Crucially the new Kantar and InfoSum partnership will allow marketers to build this detailed picture within a secure, privacy-safe framework, complementing their own user-consented data with that from Kantar. 

Sunil Modha, Sales Director at InfoSum, commented: “We are excited to partner with Kantar to give marketers a new privacy-first way to connect Kantar’s rich TGI consumer insight to their own first-party data. Safe and secure data collaboration is more important than ever. The depreciation of third-party cookies has resulted in a loss of connectivity and customer knowledge for many companies. To future-proof their marketing, brands and media owners need to be able to access insights that enable them to deliver better campaigns while protecting consumers’ personal information. That is exactly where our ‘non-movement of data’ approach comes into play.”

Sarah Sanderson, Director – Strategy, Insight & TGI, UK & Ireland, at Kantar’s Media Division, commented: “Smart brands today are developing purposeful data strategies; understanding how they can merge their own data with privacy-compliant data from other sources to develop a meaningful understanding of their customers’ drivers, preferences and attitudes. In partnering with InfoSum we are enabling advertisers to unlock the power of that detailed first-party data by combining it with the breadth and wide-ranging insight we capture through TGI.  Building on TGI’s longstanding expertise and value for advertisers, this partnership means marketers get the critical holistic, in-depth understanding of their consumers they need to inform their strategy right across the marketing cycle – from insight, to planning, to activation – in a highly data privacy compliant framework.”

Kantar’s Great Britain TGI consumer data provides a uniquely 
comprehensive 360-degree view of the offline and online 
characteristics and behaviour of Britain’s consumers.
For the TGI survey Kantar interview a representative sample of 
over 24,000 adults aged 15+ every year in Great Britain about 
their behaviour and characteristics.
Our industry-recognised data is derived from user-consented 
research generating rich insights into consumer characteristics, 
behaviours and attitudes across an extremely broad range 
of categories.
Representative survey  
of adults in Great Britain
Through our integration with InfoSum, you can now match first-party customer data 
to Kantar’s comprehensive demographic, attitudinal, product use, leisure and media 
consumption data to enrich your customer understanding and fill knowledge gaps.Insight and Enrichment
Your first-party customer data is stored in your own private cloud instance known as 
a Bunker, from there the raw data never moves, and only the Bunker owner, you, 
has access to it. To allow for privacy-first collaboration, anonymous mathematical 
representations of the data are used to (virtually) match data sets for analysis, meaning 
no personal information is ever exposed.How it worksLeverage the insight derived from your TGI-enriched first-party data to identify 
previously hidden activation audiences. This seed audience(s) informs a modelled or 
expanded addressable audience for use within the InfoSum ecosystem or distributed 
to your adtech and martech partner platforms for extended campaign reach. ActivationAbout Kantar’s partnership with InfoSumAbout Kantar’s partnership with InfoSum
This proposition is powered by a 
partnership with InfoSum. InfoSum’s 
Data Collaboration Platform and ‘non-
movement of data’ approach enables 
you to securely overlay your first-party 
data with Kantar’s TGI data for analysis, 
segmentation and activation, without 
having to share any data.
The TGI Consumer Data is powered by 
Kantar’s data-collection experts – Kantar 
Profiles – enabling us to bring together 
rich TGI Data profiles with the identity 
keys for over 400,000 panellists in  
our Bunker.
The customers within your Bunker are

Kantar and Adsquare team up to boost local advertising effectiveness 

Kantar’s TGI consumer data team has partnered with location intelligence company Adsquare to help brands build highly targeted, cookie-less and ID-free localised advertising campaigns in Great Britain and France. 
Advertisers can now pinpoint audiences in specific locations with Kantar’s TGI data set – which paints a detailed picture of consumers’ behaviours, attitudes, and media consumption – and use these directly in digital campaigns.
The collaboration means planning teams and media buyers can maximise clients’ investment by focusing campaigns to distinct audiences in the places where ad spend will have the greatest impact. The new geo-targeted audiences are available across a range of online data management and demand-side platforms, with brands also able to advertise to people through their mobiles and out-of-home assets.  The audience segments are entirely privacy secure, enabling ID-free targeting based on GDPR-compliant, opt-in consumer data.  
Sarah Sanderson, Managing Director for Kantar TGI comments: “As the deprecation of cookies draws closer, brands, agencies and media owners are seeking new, privacy-friendly ways to reach consumers. Thanks to this partnership with Adsquare, we are enhancing Kantar TGI’s capabilities again to plug the gap – allowing advertisers to engage local audiences right down to the postcode level to transform campaign efficiency.  
“Using Kantar TGI, brands can drill down into the audiences that really matter to them, with a wealth of detail about consumers.  From people who enjoy ready meals, to those who like to pay for things using crypto, there is a richness of insight across behaviours and attitudes that advertisers can leverage to deliver highly targeted and effective marketing.”
Tom Laband, CEO & Co-Founder at Adsquare, comments: “This partnership opens up a huge variety of new opportunities for anyone seeking to target almost any kind of consumer audience which offers greatest impact without the use of online identifiers. As specialists in audience and location data, we are delighted to expand our offering to include Kantar’s TGI consumer data, giving our clients additional options for ID-free targeting solutions.”

kantar.com/tgiWith cookies on their way out, one of the key ways brands 
and agencies are increasingly seeking to target consumers 
online and out-of-home in an efficient, privacy-safe way, is 
through ID-free geo-targeting.
We have partnered with audience and location intelligence 
company Adsquare to provide a huge variety of consumer 
audiences, built on our famous in-depth TGI consumer data, 
covering a variety of key sectors.  
 
These audiences are available for instant activation across 
a wide range of DMPs and DSPs, enabling you to reach your 
key consumer targets at as geographically granular a level as 
the outward code of a postcode (the first part of a postcode, 
identifying area of town or district), for better-targeted, more 
impactful campaigns.How it WorksHow it Works
These audiences are then modelled at a 
postcode level by Kantar’s data science 
experts.Kantar creates ready-made consumer 
audiences using TGI data.
Adsquare onboards the geo-modelled 
audiences and makes them available 
for activation in any of over 60 DMPs 
and DSPs.
In addition to the existing audiences, we can 
build your own bespoke audience.

TGI Audiences for Digital Activation bridge the gap between insight and activation 
At TGI we have identified and labeled key audiences in a way that colleagues who use consumer audience taxonomies daily for activation - such as that created by the IAB - will find familiar and meaningful.
This enables you to identify which audiences for digital activation have the greatest affinity with any specific consumer target you create in TGI.

Case study: Samsung

Enhancing addressable Connected TV audience targeting with TGI Consumer Data
Samsung Ads offers advertising solutions built on a unique source of first-party TV data. Their CTV advertising platform enables advertisers to reach and engage with audiences by harnessing powerful insights from over 60 million Samsung Smart TVs across Europe.
Samsung Ads identified the need to complement their first-party data targeting and measurement proposition by overlaying industry-standard addressable audiences in demographic targeting segments.
Agencies commonly use these audiences to construct TV buying audiences that are used for trading and targeting ‘currency’ in Europe, such as BARB audiences in the UK.
Samsung Ads partnered with Kantar Media to enhance their targeting solution for CTV across four European countries, using Kantar Media TGI data. 
The objective of the partnership was to predict the demographic characteristics of Samsung Smart TV viewers without the need to rely on the use of PII data. 
In 2022 we moved the offering from the testing stage to full market availability, thus enabling Samsung Ads to offer an enhanced targeting solution across both branding and performance-based CTV campaigns.
Samsung Ads chose to partner with TGI due to the extensive and detailed nature of their survey data, which is trusted and relied upon across the media industry as the data currency for the buying and selling of advertising. 
Adding to this was Samsung Ads’ determination to provide a privacy-by-design solution. The TGI dataset is a gold standard in GDPR compliance, utilising fully opted-in panelist data. Kantar TGI was a clear choice to align with Samsung’s principles of data compliance. ​

The ability to offer these audiences has enabled Samsung Ads to provide advertisers with a market-leading addressable CTV targeting proposition. This exciting project has provided the groundwork for further matching and scaling between Samsung Ads and Kantar datasets, further enhancing Samsung Ads’ abilities to offer detailed, targeted audience segments via their own market-leading CTV service.

Before suggesting TGI API as a solution, we need to thoroughly understand what the client current situation looks like.

Ask questions like about their profile and current setup, such as size of the company and if they are using an market research specialised software.

What type of data and what is their pricing?
How are you accessing this: via their platform, 3rd party, or API?
No
Once you have a good understanding of their current set up, start digging for more information about what sort of data they use and how it’s used within the company.
It is also important for us to know what our competitors are doing, so that we can be one step ahead of them.
Are you getting data from another supplier?
*Such as different type of visualisations or analysis

How will they visualise data?

Are you developing or thinking about a dashboarding tool?
What software will be used for this? E.g. Power BI or Tableau.
We can now start exploring how they want to visualise the data. 

We have seen an increased interested in dashboarding tools recently, which is something that we can facilitate data for.


What type of data is going into the dashboard?
Would you like to visualise TGI in a dashboard? 
If so, what data?
We can provide Snapshot, which gives an interactive view of TGI data.
Do you want to be able to create your own dashboard using your own in-house expertise?
Use dashboard as a platform to show case your segmentations to everyone in your business
If yes, then the solution is Aggregate API
5
Will they run segmentations?

Do you produce your own segmentation?
Do you have an in-house team for this?
We have a team that specialises in creating segmentations with TGI data, the TGI Insights team.
Yes
Are they using Python or R to analyse and classify data?
No
Are they combining data from multiple suppliers and who are they?
Would you want the option to create segmentation with TGI data?
We can offer RLD API.
Besides dashboards, we have also seen bigger agencies building their own platforms for media buying. 

If the client does not have an in-house team segmentation, we should not forget about our great TGI Insights team who can provide segmentations for them.

If the client do have their own experts, we could potentially offer them record level data (RLD) via API for them run their own advanced analysis.

6
To what extent will they use the data?

Will the software include data from other sources?
Will TGI sit alongside this data?
Yes
Will the data be used for deeper analysis using inhouse algorithms?
No
Depending on how our data will be used, we can either offer aggregate or record level data through our TGI API.

For example, OMG Omnistudio uses TGI to create targets and determine best media for that target group, which is then analysed by looking at other data to determine the best campaign mix. For this we offered them Aggregate API since they only need the total number for certain targets.

If the client is aiming to create media campaigns (run reach and frequency) or use inhouse media optimisation solution, they would then need record level data API.

7
Are there other opportunities?

Would it be helpful to have TGI alongside your media currencies (TGRs, fusions)?
What other datasets or sources are you using for strategic planning?
Does it include first party data (subscription data) or analytics data (e.g. Google analytics)?
How are you getting access to that data, via Liveramp or other CRM-partners?
Would it help to have that data linked?
To what extent is enrichment of your own data are you thinking about today?
To what extent are you getting involved in media planning / media buying?

EVs remain a long way off being a mainstream vehicle choice despite having been available several years.

What is slowing growth and how can it be stimulated?
Intent to buy a hybrid has risen faster than intent to buy an EV.

Comfortable on current income
Price, mileage, and runningcosts are cited by over 50% of petrol/diesel/ LPG owners as an important factor if they were to buy an EV.
The EV sector still has a long way to go to allay consumer concerns about the cost of going electric. 

Changing perceptions will be key to accelerating EV adoption, especially as running costs are acknowledged by experts to be cheaper for electric.

Leasing schemes make EV ownership more affordable and less problematic.

EV owners are 61% more likely than other car owners to have a car on a leasing plan.
The car industry needs to explore the pushing of leasing and company schemes to prompt growth, as they overcome cost concerns.

Gen Z: A new relationship with alcohol
An exploration of how Gen Z engage with alcohol today and how they differ to older generations
February 2025




The majority of Gen Z are shunning alcohol
This is in contrast with older groups and the population at large

A variety of factors may be driving this trend
Gen Z are more mindful of their image and spend more time on social media than other adults
Base: Ages 18 – 27. (Non-coloured figures refer to overall population)
Agree ‘People’s opinion on my appearance is very important to me’

However, 4 in 10 from Gen Z (3.4 million) do drink
Over half of these consume alcohol at least once a week
Base: Alcohol drinkers
GB TGI 2024 November (October 2023 - September 2024)- © Kantar Media 2024

Gen Z drinkers have a more moderate approach to drinking than older generations – they are 55% less likely to drink multiple times a week as well as 50% less likely to drink at home ‘to relax’.

This illustrates the more restrained, social nature of their drinking. 





4

Personality type and its effect on drinking habits
Extraversion and alcohol consumption are closely linked 
Base: All adults
GB TGI 2024 November (October 2023 - September 2024)- © Kantar Media 2024
OCEAN Values, otherwise known as the ‘big five’ personality traits, represent the broad characteristics of human behaviour.

Gen Z non-drinkers are 49% less likely to have high extraversion compared to the general adult population. This figure falls to 13% for non-drinkers born before 1997.

Gen Z drinkers are 13% more likely to exhibit high extraversion compared to the general population. This is similar to the figure of 14% more likely for drinkers born before 1997.







5

The decline in Dutch courage
Gen Z introverts are choosing the wagon as opposed to the whiskey 
Base: All adults
Whereas the introverts of older generations may have felt inclined to go out and drink as a means of fitting in, the introverts of Gen Z are increasingly not partaking at all. 

This is likely spurred by the ever-increasing entertainment available at home which prevents any fear of missing out.

Gen Z drinkers are more extraverted and open
There is a strong relationship between personality traits and drinking habits
Base: All adults
GB TGI 2024 November (October 2023 - September 2024)- © Kantar Media 2024
Non-drinker high openness

The social nature of Gen Z drinking is further reflected by the fact that they are a lot more extraverted and open than their non-drinking counterparts. The relationship is strong here.


This indicates that Gen Z do not drink to induce sociability, but rather do so to enhance the social interactions they have. 



7

Crisis in confidence among men?
Gen Z men as a whole exhibit much less openness and extraversion compared to women
Base: All adults
Men high openness
Women high extraversion
Women high openness

Gen Z drinkers are mainly composed of women
Gen Z women are more spontaneous and engage in less sport than male counterparts
Base: Ages 18 – 27. Alcohol drinkers



70% of female Gen Z drinkers agree that ‘What I want most in my life is to have fun, enjoy life’s pleasures’. This figure drops to 46% for men.


44% of female Gen Z drinkers agree that ‘I often do things on the spur of the moment’, this figure stands at 39% for men.


61% of male Gen Z drinkers engage in over 4 hours of sport per week, this figure stands at 39% for women.

Additionally, Gen Z drinkers are 30% less likely than drinkers of all ages to drink at home solely to just relax.

Women Gen Z drinkers are 2.6 times more likely than the overall adult population to consume premixed cocktail and spirit beverages.


Budget brands dominate in this segment illustrating the hedonistic nature of consumption. 


Women consumers of this beverage are 13% more likely than the average Gen Z drinker to agree that ‘The Point of drinking is to get drunk’.
12

Gen Z are different to other generations and so are their drinking habits
Here are the main takeaways from this report
GB TGI 2024 November (October 2023 - September 2024)- © Kantar Media 2024

Gen Z express more of a preoccupation with image and appearance, which is likely driving a surge in abstinence 

Gen Z drinkers are more extroverted and open than Gen Z non-drinkers; advertising messages should use social, high-energy language 

Although Gen Z drink less this is not even across both sexes - more Gen Z women drink than Gen Z men

Gen Z do the bulk of their drinking at large gatherings such as sport events and concerts

/content/drive/MyDrive/salesbot/extracted_files/others/others/TGI BD - Be Prepared Doc.docx,"Version: v5 28.02.2024 
Kantar Media TGI Business Development ‘Be prepared’ protocols 
Before speaking with client (should take about 30mins) 
Check Salesforce for past relationship/pricing
Check their website for clarity on what they do, how they do it, who their clients are, why they could need/use TGI. Ask yourself, do I understand how this client makes money? 
Google them, check Google News tab for recent press articles 
Look up the contact on LinkedIn, where have they worked before, have they been at a TGI subscriber before. What’s their seniority, who do they work with that we might know? Connect with then on LinkedIn after the call to help build your network. 
Check Campaign for industry news 
Look up if client’s brands are named on TGI (which surveys are they named on – Prem, Youth, GQV, Europa) 
What are the sample sizes, weighted sizes (good data?)
If not listed, get a good sense of sector and competitor coverage 

Jot down high-level client use cases for a client of this type – digital publisher, advertising agency, media agency, advertiser.
Keep use cases high level e.g. audience profiling, audience/market segmentation, media planning, media sales, commercial partnerships, digital activation, 1PD enrichment etc…
You can confirm, elaborate, or amend theses with client on your discovery call but gives a good grounding of use cases to cover with them. 
 
On the call 
If incoming…
Explore the reason for the enquiry, what use case/need can we support with?
Do they know/have they worked with TGI before…if so, where? 

Repeat back what you have understood is the need to ensure you fully understand. Ask for confirmation from the client if you have understood correctly. 
If you are not clear, then say so. Ask for more information on a specific blind spot; or ask more open questions to get the clarity you need. 
These use cases will form the core of your proposal, if you do not understand the need you do not understand the client = you won’t win the business 
Once the need is established, get clarity on who is using the data, who might need access to the output and what is their use case. 
Question around timelines, budget holders and other stakeholders, and if possible as if this is a competitive pitch (use judgement on this one, do not bring our competitors into the conversation unless helpful to your argument) 
Actions: Create a Salesforce opportunity and set to appropriate ‘stage’ ‘Qualification, in discussion, quote pending etc’ and add subscription/project value (if not yet clear, either leave blank or add estimate” 
Add notes from your call to Salesforce for the client record/opportunity
Continue to add a record of all comms with the client, this includes linking key emails with the clients, logging meetings and calls with notes and actions from the interaction. 

If outbound, prospecting 
Understand as much as you can about the client to find your hook. Which business issue is TGI solving? 
Have a clear view on the below:
The client (Part of a parent company? Independent? Global operation?) 
Their business (how they make money, their products/services, their business models) 
Their performance/ pain points (good year/bad year? How are they performing versus competitors?)
Their strategy (Is there anything we know about this? From trade press? Their website? From Annual company reports on their investor website, or on Companies House)
Their clients (if an agency who are their clients? If an advertiser, who are their customers, if a media owner who is their audiences and which advertisers /agencies do they work with?)
YOU WON’T BE ABLE TO ANSWER ALL THIS BEFORE A CALL! :) 
But it will make you appear informed and invested in the client, and importantly provide focus on what you need to ask the client when you do get the valuable and limited f2f time 

At the end of the call, read back to the client what you have heard, list key points, asking them to flag if you’ve missed anything. 

Actions: Create a Salesforce opportunity and set to appropriate ‘stage’ ‘Qualification, in discussion, quote pending etc’ and add subscription/project value (if not yet clear, either leave blank or add estimate” 
Add notes from your call to Salesforce for the client record/opportunity
Continue to add a record of all comms with the client, this includes linking key emails with the clients, logging meetings and calls with notes and actions from the interaction.

Understanding the value of the data to the client 
Best practice, do this before call. But if time is limited then just points 1,2 and 4 in bold below. 
You must check off all points before submitting your proposal and weave all points into your proposal to assure the client of coverage, accuracy and value to their business. 
It’s our job to be the expert on the call, to demonstrate areas of value rather than react to questions of coverage.
Look client up on TGI (which surveys are they named on – Prem, Youth, GQV, Europa) 
What are the sample sizes, weighted sizes (good data?)
Sense check the story if what the client expects to be ready for any objections 
Which competitors are listed? (media and/or brands) 
Which emerging competitors/brands are listed?
Check all areas of the dictionary for relevant /interesting data points to your client.
E.G. Lifestyle statements, conscious choices, metred data mentions V brand mentions in claimed data, segmentations. Ensure you are aware if category information is spread across different areas of the code book. 
Which data points are/could be relevant they may not have thought about? 
Mitigation for non-coverage of brand, media vehicle or sector
Points to consider; 
Can we build proxy audience(s)? 
Check the data isn’t suppressed (contact Research team)
Check if we record metred data on clients website/app/YouTube channel from the Clickstream data (contact Research) that we’re not releasing, Is sample robust to release?
Have a clear understanding of any costs, time frames and limitations of usage before committing to new additions with the clients. 
Always under promise, over deliver when it comes to adding new content to the survey. 
As you become more familiar with the database this check list will become quicker to perform.

competitor overview
Overview of company and product portfolio
Company Profile
GWI (Global Web Index) is a single -
focus business –positioned to promote 
consumer/media data and insights to 
clients with an international insights 
interest.
Company Portfolio
GWI has several component solutions within 
their portfolio
▪GWI Core (Data)
▪GWO PRO Platform (Software & Insights)
▪GWI Satellite Surveys (Data)
What are the main components of 
GWI’s business?
GWI 
Core DataGWI Pro 
PlatformOther GWI
Services
A harmonised multi -
country data -set in 46 
markets that is aimed at 
users and use -cases 
where local planning 
depth is not required.The GWI Platform 
comprises two key 
components: An interface 
for pre -packaged insight 
reports and a light data 
cross -tabulation toolGWI has grown its share of 
market by developing a more 
mature US Local service 
(GWI US; GWI Hispanic) 
and several other satellite 
offers (e.g. GWI Work)
2
Overview of GWI Methodology
Where does the data 
come from?
GWI use sample from third-party panel
providers -notably, Dynata -tofield ashort

•Accessible insights that deliver timely 
information on consumer trendsPitch:
4
Overview of GWI SWOT
•Consistent international data for 
cross -country comparison
•Proposal heavily focussed on 
servicing ‘light’ data users
•Established brand profile with digital 
media clients (social, VOD)•“One hit wonder”: Fulfils a particular 
niche on international data but no 
broader portfolio of solutions
•Data quality credentials doubted by 
many in market versus currencies (TGI)
•Lack of local service/support outside 
UK/US
•Demand for lighter and easy -to-
access solutions from advertisers
•Continued fragmentation in global 
data from established planning 
providers (YouGov; Kantar; Nielsen)
•Harmonisation of regional and 
global insight activities within 
Agency Hold Cos•Need to develop local credentials to 
entrench their services (hence: move 
into US Local space)
•Few owned assets. Dependence on 
third-party panel providers. No 
significant tech IP (e.g. no metering)
•Competitive analysis suggests clients 
would prefer single vendor and not GWI 
+ Kantar buy.GWIs Strengths: GWI’s Weaknesses:
GWI Opportunities: GWI’s Threats:Two points to pay particular attention to:
Not under -representing the importance of 
simplified global insights >
We should acknowledge the importance –
but stress that global data is only part of a 
complete insight package (which might 
include consultancy or deep -dive local 
data).
GWI’s share -of-voice and positioning on 
insight -reports >
GWI produce a lot of content (quick 
insights; Chart of the Week) but we want 
to discriminate between volume and 
quality of content. A lot of GWI insight is 
superficial and doesn’t offer enough for 
an advertiser to tell a differentiated story 
for their brand.
5
GWI is a well -developed ‘niche service’ but, 
as Kantar, we now have a newly -instituted 
global TGI Data layer (in GQV) that can fulfil 
the same use -case/need within your 
business
Unlike GWI, TGI is a portfolio product –with 
in-depth local services where you require 
them. There are incremental efficiencies in 
using Kantar for both a global and local 
view.TGI’s extra level of depth allows for 
customisation that will benefit your brand. 
We can give you different tools and 
different levels of access for each type of 
user in your businessOverview of ‘killer messages’ to the market
GWI creates a lot of generic insights –but 
we think brands require Kantar’s additional 
level of customised service and 
consultancy (from rich data -sets and local 
experts) to tell truly differentiating stories.GWI is a uniformly applied, light -touch 
online methodology that can lead to lower 
quality of outcomes for particular markets 
and regions. Only Kantar has on -the-ground 
understanding of markets to deliver the 
most trusted methods.

YouGov’s Opportunities: YouGov’s Threats:We need to be wary of two things:

endorsed YouGov. The world’s leading

YouGov do not have the research 
experts of Kantar . YouGov don’t have the

YouGov do not have the local expertise 
of Kantar . YouGov’s data isn’t backed -up 
with the market experts who understand 
Brazil and its specific requirements. YouGov 
is a ‘one size fits all’ platform only
